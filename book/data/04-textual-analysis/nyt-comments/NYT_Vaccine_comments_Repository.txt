"Andy Revkin is again nearly absolutely correct.    Ehrlich and his pals were so wrong it is mind boggling, yet they still claim that they were right.  We see this is some science fields today (and not only climate science).  <br/><br/>There is a huge helping of misanthropism in the whole population bomb meme -- thinly disguising that is is not ""people like us"" that they are worried about, but ""those people over there"" -- the poor, the uneducated, the ones with different skin colors and different cultures.  <br/><br/>The current solution seems to include denying the countries where ""those people"" live access to modern energy services -- actively suppressing their economies, preventing them from being productive and enjoying the benefits of modern civilization.   The ""give them a solar panel and a battery"" crowd patting themselves on the back for keeping the poor down where they belong.  <br/><br/>Truthfully, these types of predictions are wrong because they are all based on the false idea that every graph can have a line drawn through it extending into the future which ""tells us where we are going"".   Such trend lines do NOT really predict nor do they cause the future.  <br/><br/>Ehrlich and the Club of Rome, in their hubris caused untold damage to society -- and accept not a whit of responsibility for it.    <br/><br/>We see similar repeats of this in modern epidemiology, nutrition science, psychology, the fat wars, the salt wars, the vaccine wars, the coral reef wars, the climate science wars..science misapplied.

"In my opinion, people who are against vaccines fail to understand two key points:<br/>1) Risk assessment: They believe that anything they do or put into their body should be without any risk. The world doesn't work that way! EVERYTHING has a risk to it. If they were really concerned about risk, they would never drive anywhere and would only fly, since driving is incredibly risky - the number of people killed each year by cars is orders of magnitude greater than those that are injured by vaccines or killed in plane accidents. But wait, people still get killed in plane accidents, so maybe we shouldn't do that either? The only risk free option, then, would be to stay home. But what if a natural disaster, say a tornado, came and destroyed your house, killing you?<br/><br/>This desire to eliminate all risk simply does not work in the real world. When performing a risk assessment, the question should not be ""What is the risk of X compared to zero risk?"" but rather ""What is the risk of X compared to the next best alternative?"".  Mass vaccinations are better than this alternative, which is no vaccinations and their associated morbidity and mortality.<br/><br/>2) Lack of historical context: Everyone alive now is a beneficiary of the vaccine age. We don't have to worry about diseases that have plagued humanity for centuries. Remember when your family member died last year from smallpox, like millions of others over the centuries? Of course not, because that never happened due to vaccines! ",,,,,,,

For years I avoided the flu shot because, like you, I didn't think it could be that bad.  That is, until I actually got the true flu!  I was laid out flat for more than a week and felt like death for at least two weeks afterward.  Since then, I get one every year.

"The fact that facts do not sway people is well known to education researches and psychologists.  Physics education research has found this and also has ways of dealing with it, called IE, interactive engagement.  Essentially lecturing is replaced by students interacting with example of the target concept.<br/><br/>The tactic of asking a patient why they reject vaccines is actually productive.  With immediate refutation, you are taking advantage of reconsolidation.  The original memories then are replaced by new modified ones.  The appeal to social reasons is also a good tactic.<br/><br/>MDs are so used to lectures that they assume that they work well.  Perhaps they should study the literature generated by the physics community on how well IE works and how poorly lecture works.  Standard lecture courses have gain in understanding of around 13%, max 25%.  IE research based courses have gain from 35% to 70% and in rare cases even higher.  IE always does a better job than just telling.  If MDs were trained in an IE manner they would probably also be better!!!",,,,,,,

Do we really know that the entire autism spectrum is caused by the same genes?  Do we even know which genes are involved yet?  I didn't think that things were all that clear yet.  And if we know that we are dealing with specific genes why on earth would some people still blame vaccines?,,,,,,,
"It appears, at this point, that hundreds of genes may be involved.  Recent research finds that roughly half of all cases are probably due to combination effects of large numbers of common gene mutations, not small numbers of rare ones.<br/><br/>People cling to vaccines as an explanation either because it's very tempting to think that there is ONE thing they can blame it on, and therefore find an answer or a treatment for or some kind of control over...or because they misinterpret what they're seeing without sufficient historical knowledge.  Like many grade school teachers say things like ""We NEVER saw this many autistic kids two or three decades ago!""  And they're right.  Not because there truly are more autistic kids, but because more of them are in school instead of in institutions, or mainstreamed to at least some degree instead of isolated in self-contained special ed classrooms, because schools are now required to accommodate us in ways they didn't used to be.  Also, more kids are diagnosed now whose problems 20 or 30 years ago were just misattributed to other things.  I was known for being ""shy"" when in fact I could barely talk, for instance.",,,,,,,

Most people I know have one of two defaults: avoid everything that has any potential for harm, which is exhausting, pretty much impossible, and often goes down the destructive route of including things like vaccines on the dangerous list; or ignore it all and just keep living. I wish there were a realistic third way. ",,,,,,,
"1. You're the one using all caps, not Kristof (or anyone else here).<br/><br/>2. They are complaining about the lack of studies to prove things safe, not studies which have proven things dangerous.<br/><br/>3. The reason people are less likely to accept things not proven safe in their food, than in their medicine, is that we have an existing food source, or at least, we did, that was working well to feed us for millions of years. Whereas, we did not have an existing way to prevent viruses or cure bacterial infections. So my risk tolerance for food changes is way lower than my risk tolerance for vaccines, for example.<br/><br/>Nobody is thinking ""my nonstick pan will definitely kill me and my baby"".

"California Mandates Vaccines for Schoolchildren<br/><br/>Vaccines are a very crucial element for our health, not just for our personal health reasons but also for other peoples' health. Vaccines are meant to protect our bodies against diseases but many parents are declining vaccines due to religious or personal reasons they might have. However, not receiving vaccinations can lead to more diseases being spread and it also puts children at risk with the general public also being at risk with these infectious diseases, take for example the Disneyland incident, where there was an outbreak of measles. Even though, as Jerry Brown said, ""no medical intervention is with out risk..."", I understand how some parents may be frightened to give their child vaccines with all the possible effects that they might have seen or heard of. For instance, the debate on whether or not vaccines are linked to autism. So there are more and more children who are not receiving vaccines due to the given option of parents wanting to or not wanting to give their child the vaccine that is based upon the parents' influences which is not a valid reason to not give their child his or her vaccine, putting the child in possible danger and the people around that child. So in my personal opinion, this new law signed by Governor Jerry Brown is in everyone's best interest that this bill was passed. It is also a good step forward to prevent future out breaks and to create a better healthy life style for all of us.",,,,,,,
"While browsing through the Health section of the Times, I found an interesting article, ‚ÄúFor Vaccines Needed in an Epidemic, Timing Is Everything‚Äù. While the article bore the happy news that an Ebola vaccine has been proven to work, it also shared some shocking information.  According to Dr. Berkeley, an executive with the vaccination industry Gavi, the Ebola vaccine was proven effective on monkeys nearly ten years ago.<br/>Until the Ebola crisis in 2014, the vaccine sat in limbo for an entire decade.  Because of this delay, health care providers were unable to administer the life-saving drug, and thousands of people died from the epidemic.  This is not the first time that vaccines have been delayed until an epidemic strikes, according to the article.<br/>A similar vaccine crisis to the 2014 Ebola outbreak is happening right now in Saudi Arabia. A deadly virus known as MERS is sweeping through the nation and has already spread to South Korea.  Vaccine trials have been road blocked up until this point for political and financial reasons. But trial expenses are a small price to pay when people‚Äôs lives are at stake.  Had vaccine tests for the Ebola vaccine not been stilted due to politics, thousands of lives could have been saved.  Instead, the vaccines were left untested, and those left to suffer from the greed and political agendas of government officials were the people of Africa.  If something isn‚Äôt done about the MERS vaccine blocks soon, another worldwide epidemic may be imminent.",,,,,,,

I feel as if  society has become dependent and reliant on having an immediate fix to their problems that will inevitably occur. This lack of sense of danger is a downfall when preventing future problems. This article interested me, because it sparked a debate in which should we only focus on preventing the problem that is in front of us or do we continue to advance to preemptively  stop future problems or diseases. The sad truth that I found is that our human nature will question wether or not life or lives is worth the amount of money spent to save it. The creation of a vaccine mirrors our accomplishment of doing well in that moment for brief amount of time and our unconscious decision making. This situation at least made me question wether I spend time dealing with problems that have already happened or making sure I prevent problems from happening in the first place. ",,,,,,,
"For Vaccines Needed in an Epidemic, Timing is Everything<br/><br/>I chose to read about vaccines and the timing of them as they are developed to save lives.   In Africa, where Ebola was spread they didn't have the vaccine fast enough and spent millions of dollars to create it.  Then, as they had finally a sufficient vaccine the disease had already subsided.  I really enjoyed reading about what the scientists ideas were on how to fix this problem on getting reliable vaccines created before the disease runs its course.  I can argue for both sides because I believe that putting the money into making the vaccines is a smart idea, but it seems, from my perspective, that the scientists are great at making the vaccines on the spot as diseases come and go.  Investing the money doesn't make it a guarantee for them to make the vaccine in time for people to benefit before it subsides.  But then again I believe that having the money might make all the studies after the vaccine is made easier and smoother making the future vaccines come out faster.  Overall, I can argue for both sides and would love to continue reading about what the scientist would choose in the future.         ",,,,,,,
"For Vaccines needing in an epidemic, timing is everthing <a href=""http://nyti.ms/1IsRr4t"" title=""http://nyti.ms/1IsRr4t"" target=""_blank"">http://nyti.ms/1IsRr4t</a> <br/><br/>When the world is hit by rare and dangerous diseases most of the time it's very sudden and many unfortunately pass away, because there is no cure for a disease or the disease subsides.  Scientists put a lot of time and effort to get a vaccine in time, but it's very hard to get a vaccine that is safe and effective with modern medicine. To make vaccines researchers and scientists need cells and animals to test on which cost millions of dollars to perform. In the article an example they give is Ebola which was a VERY deadly disease and was also very contagious. This epidemic scared the public and killed those who were infected. Doctors agreed on the fact f the vaccine was made 2 or 3 years earlier they could have saved the lives of many. Even though epidemics such MERS and Ebola have died down, Major pharmaceutical companies are too scared to try their experimental vaccines on humans. I would like to think the goverment or whoever is incharge of these vaccines and funding will think ahead in the future. ",,,,,,,

This disease is known to paralyze its victims and can even be fatal. This disease reached its peak in the 40's in America, but it has been a huge epidemic in Africa for ages. It is now reported that there haven't been any polio cases in a year thanks to ""community mobilizers."" These mobilizers have set up operation centers to vaccinate people, especially children, and track the progress of the disease. I think setting up centers that monitor people's vaccinations and personal hygiene throughout countries that are disease-ridden is one of the best ways fatal diseases can be avoided. This is  because if people have the proper sanitary items such as soap, shots, and feminine items, then germs are less likely to spread which decreases the rise of serious illnesses. With no reported polio cases in a year, Africa has made a significant advance not only in their overall health as a nation, but it has hopefully encouraged other countries to take steps towards the vital necessities needed for a healthy life.

The school has the right to be concerned of their safety, and take the necessary precautions to do so. I grew up getting vaccines and saw nothing wrong with my parents wanting to protect me from getting a serious disease like Measles. However I relate to the parents who don‚Äôt feel their kids should be vaccinated as well. While I would choose vaccinations as a precaution, I would also raise my children to be healthy, by keeping good hygiene and eating right. A lot of the parents against vaccinations feel they raised their kids well enough to prevent them from getting disease. They feel the vaccine is just unnecessary. With the speculation of Autism it is easy to see why. I stand firmly on the idea that doctors should have the freedom to choose whether they treat vaccinated patients or not. If a patient who has the disease is in the environment when other kids immune systems are already low, they risk spreading it to others. A child should not get even more sick going to a place that was meant to treat them. It should be mandatory children be vaccinated if the disease is present and spreading. ",,,,,,,
"Children Die Because People Are Wrongly Afraid of Vaccines<br/> A vaccine is a ‚Äúdrug‚Äù injected into adults and children to provide one with immunity to that disease; however, recently many people have opted their children out of receiving these vaccines. This editorial explains the reasons behind these decisions to show the audience that being vaccinated is not a danger. To start, the author explains the effect of people refusing to vaccinate their children. This tactic is effective in the editorial because it provides facts and statistics about the outcome of the children‚Äôs lives. The Editorial Board then explains the many reasons behind why adults are becoming anti-vaccine. They discuss cultures, beliefs, and religions that prevent these vaccinations. By doing this, the author rules out most average people because many against vaccinations live in unusual circumstances. In addition, throughout the article the author insists that the main reason as to why people refuse is because of the scientific aspect to it. They also state that most of this information is not true and only a myth. The last eye catching tactic the author uses is the title. A title like this can not be missed and definitely invites an audience. The only thing the author could have included was the positive effect of vaccinations which would have added an extra push to the writer‚Äôs point of view. In the end, this editorial was well written and has the ability to persuade people to supporting vaccination.  ",,,,,,,
"Children Die Because People Are Wrongly Afraid of Vaccines<br/>              Throughout the article, the author tries to warn the public of the danger of ignorance that comes with people hesitating to vaccinate themselves and their children. By withholding themselves from the vaccines, it puts others at risk for high risk diseases.  The argument justifies that this hesitancy, comes from the false information that vaccines put children at risk for autism. Some of the best arguments during the article, are the statistics that verify the deaths of millions, from those who turn away from vaccines, from illogical myths.Not only that, but the argument goes further to point out other factors of vaccine hesitancy, ranging from people who have religious views on it, to the philosophical roles also. During the article, the points made are easy enough for anyone to question, who anyone would be against vaccinations when millions die every year by not taking them. There was no uncertainty in the article, which made the goal easy and clear for the reader to follow. This article takes place in a perfect time, since nowadays whether you're pro or anti vaccination is definitely taking a big part in the social issue aspect of our country.  New diseases are always arising making vaccines questionable, as if they are actually working; they leading others to come to the conclusion that maybe vaccines aren't worth taking and they would be better off without them at all, which has dangerous results.

"Children Die Because People are Wrongly Afraid of Vaccines : NYT Editorial Board <br/><br/>One of the most revolutionary discoveries in modern medicine was the vaccine. Ever since the first documentation of the vaccine in the late 18th century, they have saved millions of lives from preventable diseases, but recently, many of parents or guardians have not been giving their children vaccines, which has caused annually about 1.5 million deaths of children. The NY Times Editorial Board wrote this editorial in response to this increasing problem. One of the Board's best arguments for why the rate of parents who do not give their children vaccines is that they are skeptical of its affects. According to the editorial, in rural ethnic minority communities, the main concern of vaccines is the use of needles, and in more suburban areas, the main concern is that the vaccines will cause autism in the children. Throughout families, there is a general mistrust in modern medicine. This is one of the most well constructed arguments because it addresses all families, not singling out on one race or class. Another valid argument made was that even parents with higher education were not less susceptible to vaccination hesitancy. Again, this is a good argument because it addresses all types of families. Lastly, one of the main strategies the Board used was providing multiple statistics and facts. This strategy really helped back up the argument because it helped paint a real picture of the problem.

Every year I dread having to get a shot. Most if not every kid does. It starts with the smell of rubbing alcohol, then the unnerving anticipation, and finally that little prick that caused so much worry. As much as I hate getting vaccinated, I wouldn‚Äôt want to go without it. When I read about the 1.5 million children who die because they didn‚Äôt receive the life saving vaccines, I was astonished. Whether it‚Äôs parents who refuse vaccinations for fear of the vaccines causing autism or religious purposes, children are still dying. It is my belief that everyone should have religious freedom but when there are this many cases of deaths due to a lack of immunization, something has to be done. No one can force a parent to vaccinate a child but there should be more effort to inform parents of the risk that they put their child in by refusing to have them immunized. Parents should also do more research on how a vaccine may harm their child before jumping to conclusions and denying their kids vaccinations These are life saving vaccines and should be given to as many people as possible.",,,,,,,
"A Milestone in Africa: No Polio Vaccines in a Year<br/><br/>Polio vaccines are vital in rural areas of Africa and also in other areas such as Pakistan and Afghanistan. For a year, no cases of polio have been reported. Many organizations and the World's Health Organization decided to go into these areas where polio was persistent in attempts to eradicate it. Polio rates have gone down tremendously world-wide. <br/><br/>Though this is a huge step in the progression of eradicating polio, two more years must past before it becomes truly eradicated from Africa. I believe these efforts are saving lives and creating better futures for those in Africa and other countries without sufficient healthcare. It is just one step though,¬† into making these countries healthier. Politics must be involved to establish health care, but this is a humanitarian effort. One by one diseases and sicknesses should be tackled and helping the government's people and economy may help it to become a healthier country.",,,,,,,

"I am tired of this false argument that GMO's pose no harm, and are the same type of gene modification that is essential in evolution.<br/>First, the harm GMO crops do are to the environment, by allowing normal crops to be blasted with pesticides, so that all other edge species are killed. The decline of Monarch butterflies, previously able to survive on edge growth of plants like Jimson Weed, now no longer have even that fragmentary landscape. The increase in mono-culture farming is also causing Monarch die-back, but that fact does not let round-up resistant crops off the hook.<br/>Secondly, GMO crops harm the economy. The persecution of farmers, the concentration of wealth in the big pesticide companies (Monsanto) that dependence on these GM crops causes is WELL documented!!!<br/>This is the opposite direction we want our agriculture to go in.<br/>We want to preserve local seed varieties, we want to promote small-scale farming that does not require transport to the other side of the earth for sale, and we want to cultivate environmental health for our world around us.<br/>You cannot compare the anti-GM-ers to the anti-VAXXers - the ill effects on the economy  (concentration of wealth) and the environment (species die-off, loss of local seed stock) are documented and real.<br/>This is all I am allowed to write, but I could go on.",,,,,,,
"Dr. Morris, please don't try to derail debate on the subject by asserting authority on a subject where none is warranted (as was the attempt by your use of the physician title).  Unless you have clinical data to back up your claims, I'm not sure your status as a Naturopathic Doctor is relevant to the discussion. Further, your concerns seem to be ill informed.<br/><br/>First, you assert that ""GMO crops inherently lack the diversity needed to evolve and resist various infections."" True. So what? So do most crops, GMO or not.  How many different types of banana do you see at the store (2)? How about grapefruit (2)? Potatoes (3 - 4)? Most crops are farmed for consistency, thus GMOs are no worse than other crops. <br/><br/>Second, your arguments regarding pesticides only refer to two specific GMO products.  The entire class of GMOs are not related to pesticide resistance.  I tend to not trust Monsanto, so I'm largely in agreement with you here.<br/><br/>Third, terminator genes...Yes, Monsanto owns the patent and hasn't used it.  No, this is not relevant to the safety of GMO products generally.<br/><br/>Fourth, your assertion regarding pollination is an old wive's tale.  I've found no proof that this actually happened.  If you have evidence, I'd be happy to see it.<br/><br/>In short, you've presented no supportable evidence that GMOs are bad.  And you apparently purposefully ignore the positives (increased nutrients, faster growth, production of vaccines, etc).  Maybe you should reevaluate your position?",,,,,,,

"Anyone who gardens seriously knows (or should) that virtually everything we plant has been extensively modified and deliberately bred for certain key characteristics.

The Smithsonian magazine had an excellent article recently on the question of why people have become so anti-science, that even disproven theories (e.g., vaccination causes autism) so easily become thoroughly embedded in people's consciousness.",,,,,,,
"It's one thing to argue that GMO foods are safe and desirable, but this article goes further, suggesting that, because they're safe and desirable, the US shouldn't require labeling of GMO foods like the labeling required in the EU and many other countries.  <br/><br/>That is misguided, because some people simply don't want to eat GMO foods, regardless of safety.  Sometimes they want to avoid it for political reasons, and sometimes they just don't trust the governmental organizations that are telling them GMOs are safe.  (This is the same government, after all, that used to recommend trans fat and, in the early decades of the 20th Century, allowed radium to be put in foods and beverages).<br/><br/>Unlike refusing to vaccinate one's children, refusing to buy GMO foods does not hurt anyone else and there is no reason why society shouldn't permit people to make that choice.  Not labeling foods with GMOs violates the right of citizens to be informed about what they're eating and drinking.",,,,,,,

Mainstream media has been even tardier, but now you are here.<br/>The delay is not without consequences:<br/>Aside from the curious fact that the most vocal and widely followed purveyors of anti GMO propaganda are also opposed to vaccination, the demands of people fearful of what they do not understand come at a dollar cost to regulatory agencies, which do not even now have sufficient funding to safeguard the countries stores and production methods from infections which actually do kill people.

This article is as important as it is confusingly written.

If people are going to resist such a necessary part of our society, then I believe we should push the issue and force people to vaccinate their children.  Not vaccinating a child because of belief is like starving and beating a child because of belief in my book.  Just because you believe something doesn't make it right.  Also, people are arguing that it is a violation of civil rights because the government is taking away their freedom of choice.  This is one issue, I believe, that only warrants one choice, keeping your child healthy.  Their is no reason to worry anymore about the safety of vaccinations because of research done by scientists all over the world.  All in all, their no logical reason to fight this bill except that people felt like it",,,,,,,
Making vaccines mandatory. I feel like if forcing parents to get their children vaccinated will help lower the risk of other children getting infected. This will help create a safer environment for teachers and students. On the other hand I do side with parents not getting their children vaccinated the do have to the right to choose the health of their own children. Having your child vaccinated also gives off the sense of being safe and knowing their is chance of having a healthy and safe life inside and outside of school.,,,,,,,
"This is what modern medicine is all about.Medicine has come a long way from the discovery of Penicillin and Vaccines Besides the great discoveries, there is problem solving. Breaking down the  protocols in minute detail, looking at the weak links and finding solutions to strengthen those links allows medical care becomes a smooth, fluid process improving outcomes. I congratulate the medical field for their tireless, continuing quest towards perfection.<br/>Now if only the Air Force took notes from the Medical field and tried to problem-solve their over-burdened, over-worked, rapid burnout rates of their drone-operators in Utah. We could perhaps save thousands of lives who become collateral damage.",,,,,,,
"JIMMY CARTER has sponsored a project that has nearly eradicated the Guinea worm that has been a scourge, primarily in Africa.  He has been true to his commitment to help those who are less fortunate.  And given his announcement of his liver cancer metastasized to his brain, I wish him all the luck in the world for speedy and full healing and recovery.  That said, I also invite Jimmy to announce an vaccination initiative for children in the US, especially for parents who disbelieve in their effectiveness.  I firmly believe that his sending a message now that parents must help their children, themselves and their communities by cooperating with school requirements to have their children vaccinated.  Such an announcement would add to his long list of remarkable contributions to the wellbeing of humans worldwide, and perhaps persuade some unconvinced parents to act to safeguard their children's health as a patriotic duty.",,,,,,,

On the other hand Roundup is bad news...because it helping set the stage for mass extinction by helping to decrease biodiversity.",,,,,,,
"The medical establishment needs to apologize to Dr. Andrew Wakefield en masse, he was the first who noticed, published, and lectured about the connection of the gut to autism and linked it to vaccines. Not the vaccine hysteria that we've seen recently, but the impact of vaccinations on the integrity of the gut wall and the changes created in the gut flora. <br/><br/>Dr. Wakefield was vilified, his career destroyed in the US and UK because of his assertions about what he SAW in the guts of children within the autistic spectrum. He was a young man with a young family, routed from the UK, driven from practicing in the US by those with a vested interest in the status quo. What happened to him was criminal. He was one doctor who actually listened to the mothers of autistic children who had observed their children and the changes that occurred subsequent to dietary changes, and subsequent to being vaccinated. <br/><br/>Shocking really, he listened to mothers of children. For that he was destroyed by the medical community. Cheers to Wakefield, Lyte, Mazmanian, Hsiao, Patterson, Dr. Michael Gershon, author of ""The Second Brain"" published in 1998, and to the many doctors in Norway, Ireland and around the world who've been working on this connection for decades! God speed!",,,,,,,

"I am a vegan. I do not believe raising and slaughtering any sentient being is ethical. That said, the Yulin Dog Meat Festival is particularly heinous. There are no standards for dog slaughter. No stunning, no slaughter guidelines. Most are beaten to death: this would not be tolerated for most any animal. Some are burned alive. Most are transported in the most inhumane conditions: heat, no water, smothering on top of one another. Many are stolen pets. Most have not been vaccinated. Most have no certificates. This is an underhanded, illegal trade for the most part. As a vegan, I do not support the killing and eating of any animal. And yes, there are instances of mass abuse of hens, pigs, cows and other typically farmed animals. But that doesn't make the dog meat trade, and the mass abusive killing of dogs and cats for this festival any less heinous. We are right to be outraged. No amount of pig and chicken deaths can make this more palatable. ",,,,,,,

Cats would be given wooden cat houses in parks and fed and watered by city employees (think NYPD horses and dogs).

"'California mandates vaccines for schoolchildren'<br/><br/>The states that have mandated to have all children in school vaccinated, have many logical reasons. Families that can afford to vaccinate their children to help fight off viruses in their children's school have no reason not to do so. Religion should not be an issue with helping other children remain healthy and virus free. Like everything else these days vaccines probably cost families money, which to a less financially steady families with more than one child in school could result in an issue. The state of California is going about this all wrong. Children that are not vaccinated should not be made to be home schooled. There may be other reasons aside from being religiously against vaccines that families can not give their child the vaccines they need. These states are just trying to help keep American as safe from viruses as they can but should do so in a more approachable and less consequential way.",,,,,,,
"California Mandates Vaccines for Schoolchildren<br/>A child is quite possibly a parent's most precious possession. Most mothers and fathers will do everything in their power to protect their kid(s). This is why when it comes to vaccines, conflicting sides emanate between those who vaccinate their children to protect them from dangerous diseases and those who don't due to religious or medical reasons. The article I read titled ""California Mandates Vaccines for Schoolchildren"" reports the law California passed that requires schoolchildren to be vaccinated unless there is a medical reason not to do so. It also states that a long and heated debate took place before the decision was made. This article interested me because I fully support vaccinating children when they enter school. Vaccinating would not only protect children from spreading/getting diseases in school but it would also prevent spreading in public places. For example, if more children had been vaccinated, the horrific outbreak in Disney would not have spread to so many people. The article states that failure to vaccinate is the reason why immunity levels are so low in communities. Even though a lot more steps need to be taken to reach a healthy community where diseases are minimal, vaccinations are a tremendous first step to reach that goal. ",,,,,,,
"California Mandates Vaccines for Schoolchildren<br/>July 2nd 2015<br/>A new California law makes sure that all children must be vaccinated in order to attend school. This law will not excuse children from vaccinations due to religious or personal beliefs. This law was passed as a response to the outbreak in measles this year at Disney land. The outbreak at Disney land was partly due to the fact that many children were not vaccinated for the measles. Families that refuse to vaccinate their children would have to home school their children.<br/>This article interested me because it is surprising that this law was just now passed. I mean Vaccination is a very common thing and for me it was mandatory. What also surprised was that there was a very heated debate over this law. I suppose some people might argue for religious freedom saying medicine is not what they believe in but this is of little concern when a virus kills a child. Really how it this law just now coming to fruition? It should have been passed a long time ago before the outbreak at Disney land. Vaccination is safe, healthy and protects people from very nasty viruses and diseases. I just don't understand why someone would not want their child vaccinated.<br/>I am personally glad that this law was passed. It is a very big step towards insuring the livelihood of children and the adults they will one day become. I would not think of this new law as just vaccination law but a law protects the children that will one day be our future.  ",,,,,,,
"The number of Californian kids that aren't vaccinated is so low that the legislation created a law that forces parents to vaccinate their kids. If a child is not vaccinated, then the parent has to homeschool their child. <br/><br/>The law was created for the greater good of California. Vaccines are proven to effectively help kids' health by giving them almost complete protection from infectious diseases. People who don't vaccinate their kids affect everyone else. If a child has a disease, like cancer, that prevents them from getting vaccinated, they are vulnerable to all the other infectious diseases, like chickenpox. It‚Äôs especially bad for them, because they‚Äôre already weak from their disease, it‚Äôs harder for them to fight off the new disease. That is why children should get vaccinated. <br/><br/>I disagree with this new law because it violates two rights. It violates the right of Californian children to be educated and the right of parents to choose how to take care of their children. I wouldn‚Äôt like this law if it was in Ohio, where I live, because I wouldn‚Äôt feel like I had the freedom to choose how to parent my child the way I want. Although I‚Äôm thirteen and have no kids, I still think parents should have that freedom. <br/><br/>I can‚Äôt decide whether I completely agree or disagree with the law because both sides of the argument have really good points. However, I am glad that California will be healthier because of the law.",,,,,,,

"I just looked up the whole cell vaccine, and according to the World Health Organization, it ""has been frequently associated with minor adverse reactions such as redness and swelling at the site of injection, along with fever and agitation.""

I mean, redness and swelling? Who cares?",,,,,,,
"The problem is if you get pertussis while vaccinated then the vaccine isn't working. You get a milder case, but you still get it and can spread it. This is a serious problem and one we must address sooner rather than later. <br/><br/>We must ask ourselves as a society if the risk of side effects from the whole-cell vaccine outweigh reduced efficacy of the acellular vaccine. Are the risks of the side effects of the whole-cell vaccine worse than the risks of the disease in the unprotectable? The ethics of science will only allow the scientists to consider the risks of the side effects on the person receiving the vaccine and not the risks to the many who can not be vaccinated.

"Perhaps we need to make it easier for people to get and keep their vaccines up to date.  One way would be for doctors to send their patients reminders, something most don't do.  When I asked my FP why he didn't do that sort of thing he said it was too much trouble.  In a way he's right, it is too much trouble because we have a very fragmented and uncommunicative health care system.  We make appointments to see doctors and wait 2 hours.  We need medical care during off hours and we have to rely upon the ER or one of the clinics that will see us on a moment's notice but may or may not be on our health plan.  <br/><br/>If we want better coverage for items like vaccines, the flu, etc., we need to move away from our wealth care system which benefits the health care industry rather than the patients.

My brother contracted mumps as a child after he had the vaccine. Fortunately for him, the only lasting damage has been infertility, but that has been devastating to him and his wife.<br/><br/>I watched a friend fight back against polio and learn to walk again. It was an arduous process for her and exhausting for her and her family. She was fortunate in so far as the disease did not attack her breathing muscles, but it took her autonomy for many years.<br/><br/>I've had friends whose immune systems have been depleted by their treatments for cancer. They rely on those around them to be immunized so they don't have to worry about many of these devastating ""childhood"" diseases (many times, getting them as an adult is much worse). <br/><br/>My question is: Are we certain that the risk of these side effects are higher than the risk of not receiving complete immunity to whooping cough? From the sounds of this article, I don't think they are.",,,,,,,

"What do you mean by ""up to date""?  Where is an adult supposed to go for vaccines, or even know what vaccines they are supposed to be getting (other than the flu)?  Adults don't have regular general doctors, that is just a fact of life in the US.  <br/><br/>I read an article about young people getting shingles because the immunity from the chicken pox vaccine wears off with time, and so I went to the local CVS clinic with my husband to get shingles vaccines.  The clinic said they wouldn't give it to us without a separate perscription from a doctor!  If they did give it to us, I hear it would be $200/each out of pocket, since my husband and I are each only about 40 years old, so too young for insurance coverage.<br/><br/>In the US, it is a lot of work and expense for adults to get vaccines.

While antibiotics are losing their effectiveness through overuse, vaccines are being attacked based on the scientific ignorance and hubris of celebrity spokes-nitwits.  We're losing our first line of defense against common diseases that can maim and kill, and these people are speeding up the problem.<br/><br/>As bad Jenny McCarthy and her ilk are, far worse are the people who give them a forum for spreading their deadly misinformation.

Frank Bruni has perfectly summed the vaccine debate: a tug-of-war between facts that protect the public and fiction that endangers it.  I was pleased to see at every hearing on this vaccine bill in California that the majority of the lawmakers shared this same kind of clear and compassionate thinking.  And it was a relief to witness intelligent legislators unwilling to be swayed by the anti-vax movement no matter how famous their name or image.   Personal belief exemptions do not save lives.  Vaccines save lives. Thank you Frank for supporting California in this common sense modification of our public health policy. ,,,,,,,
"Fascinating how the media always portrays parents who are concerned about vaccines as being concerned about mercury causing autism. Except around here, ground zero for low vaccination rates, I've never heard a parent express their concern. Rather it is the number or vaccines given at one time, the sheer number of vaccines, and the age at which they start.<br/>Parents are concerned about overwhelming their children's immune systems. Eight vaccines at one time by 8 weeks of age. They feel that when added to all the other insults a developing fetus is exposed to, that their children could be at risk. Clearly that is so, with the skyrocketing rates of autism, whatever the cause. Let's see - cell phone towers and cell phones emitting EMF's, GMO's and heavily chemically laden foods, up to 10 ultrasounds, antibiotics in food... i mean, why would anyone be concerned about a child receiving 49 vaccines by the age of 6 years???<br/>And, while we are at it, and even once reported in the Times last year, Merck, the sole manufacturer of the MMR vaccine, is the subject of two whistleblower lawsuits by senior scientists at both Merck and the CDC for falsifying data about the MMR vaccine.<br/>This is not the world you grew up in. I had all my vaccines - let's see: smallpox, measles, maybe mumps. Not much more. Not at age 8 weeks.",,,,,,,

That fallout can be debilitating. Read above. When the measles rash clears or the whooping cough stops, that does not necessarily mean the end of the disease.

They've seen babies who were developing normally suffer adverse reactions to vaccines administered at an absurdly young age.

Some babies do not develop normally and have problems, and they happened to have vaccinations like most children.    Is it caused by vaccinations?  There is absolutely no scientific evidence to support this.  But there is evidence that the vaccinations have almost eliminated terrible diseases which have killed and destroyed many people.

I remember seeing a severely impaired child in the 1980s. Her mother told everyone that she could find that this was caused by the DPT shot. But my senior partner, who had cared for the family for years said, yes, but she will not tell you that every previous child she had died of the same problem, which was found at autopsy to be a profound hereditary global malfunction of the brain.

They are unvaccinated, not because we are poor, but because the state of Washington allows virtually anyone to avoid vaccinating his children if he doesn't feel like it.

"Generally, I am receptive to the notion of vaccinating children to immunize them against a broad array of diseases.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with vaccines, per se.   But there is a problem with a preservative in vaccines known as thimerosol.   This compound contains mercury, a notorious neurotoxin and known to be a neurotoxin for hundreds of years (In the late Middle Ages, the term Mad as a hatter was coined; people in the hat business were in contact with mercury and at times became mad)  Bruni said that levels of thimerosol, in vaccines,  have been reduced.  That's not the info I've gotten.  I have heard, in particular, that the DPT vaccines, against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus have high levels of thimerosol.<br/><br/>Finally, I resent the notion that we who advise caution about vaccines are antedeluvian.

Parents who choose not to vaccinate should be required to warn the public whenever their child is in any public area, and should be liable for damages in the event that they spread contagion.",,,,,,,
"The originator of the now debunked tie between autism and the measles vaccine was a British doctor, whose article In the Lancet was withdrawn by the journal and whose license to practice was terminated.  Many point to that episode as the start of this anti-vaccine hysteria.  It is of a piece with the current anti-intellectualism on the right.  The large majority who oppose this nonsense need to assert themselves.  These fools have no more right to endanger public health than their counterparts in the religious fringe have to impose their beliefs.",,,,,,,
"I think we should keep the issues clear.  The study that linked vaccines to autism has long been disproved and so on. So the excuse that vaccinating children will cause autism isn't valid. Beliefs are a problem, but we do know that Christian Scientists will forego medical treatments.  Probably, with mandatory vaccinations with exceptions for medical reasons and some way to file for an exemption for Christian Scientists (clearly documented religious beliefs as opposed to individual religious or other beliefs), the number of unvaccinated children will be small enough to not disturb the ""herd.""<br/><br/>However, it is important that the groups that look at these issues continue to look at them, to make sure that vaccines are truly safe. Don't dismiss those who would be watchdogs in this area.  My own experience is that all the vaccines I've had over the years have not produced a problem, but the heavy metal they use in MRIs caused a serious problem, so staying on top of safety in medicine is important.<br/><br/>And there is a ""big pharma.""

Vaccines have adjuvants that strike hard to inflate immune system response, which can be fine if the immune system can handle it.  Many things affect whether it can, and they need to be studied and planned around.  Those who attack the viewpoint of people who wish to be cautious at least should admit certain facts:  our government has paid out several billions in vaccine-injury claims, and the Supreme Court upheld exempting vaccine manufacturers from liability because vaccines are ""inherently unsafe"".  Mandates for administering something ""inherently unsafe"" need exemptions backed by logic and designed to protect the recipient (in case of doubt, at least let the patient/parent have a choice).

"Not vaccinating children is not ""being cautious.""  It is being foolhardy.  Perhaps the schedule for vaccinations could be spread out.  As someone who has had measles, mumps, and chicken pox as a child and seen people become crippled by polio (none of my personal friends died, luckily), I ask that you read some of the science more carefully.  If people want to wait until their kids are closer to school age, fine.  Vaccinate them then.  However, if parent refuse, then they can home school or find like-minded parents who want to set up a private school for all non-vaccinated kids.  When the kids start getting these formerly common childhood illnesses again I am sure they will thank their parents for ""protecting"" them.  P.S. As a health care worker I have recently seen some babies who died from Pertussis, aka whooping cough.  The grief of their parents was heart breaking.  Babies cannot be vaccinated for this disease and need the protection of the herd immunity that we have been discussing.

There are some risks in vaccines, much smaller than the anti-vaxxers realize and the risks of the disease they protect against are very real. Three cheers for our lawmakers and Jerry Brown.  Our governor is for environmentalism and progressivism.  He is, however, not hippy-dippy.  ",,,,,,,
"Thimerosal, which is approximately 50% mercury by weight, has been one of the most widely used preservatives in vaccines. It is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate. Ethylmercury is an organomercurial that should be distinguished from methylmercury, a related substance that has been the focus of considerable study.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228"" title=""http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafe...</a>",,,,,,,
"Before polio vaccine, I had childhood friends who got polio. They were crippled for life. I did not personally know anyone who died form it.  When the Salk vaccine become available, we all lined up at school.  Every child was happy to get the vaccine.  We were terrified of becoming wheelchair bound, in an iron lung or dying from Polio.  The shots were given at no cost (the research had been funded by the March of Dimes).  Salk was a bona fide hero to us.  I never thought I'd see such an over-blown, reactionary situation against vaccines.  When my sister and I had measles, she was practically comatose for two weeks.  She was not a strong child, having had rheumatic fever in second grade and had been bedridden for months.  Every time she had a childhood illness, it was very, very serious.  I usually was less affected because I was stronger.  Mothers in those years had to take care of kids during various episodes of multiple childhood diseases.  I wonder how the anti-vax crowd would like to do that kind of home nursing.  I think they are being foolish, obstinate and selfish.",,,,,,,
"My father was a pharmacist, and when the polio vaccine was released my mother wanted, demanded, he move heaven and earth to get it.  I got the shot and thankfully avoided polio awaiting it.  I did have mmr, and I mean the diseases as well as chicken pox. Let's just say I wish there had been a vaccine.  They were not pleasant childhood memories.",,,,,,,
"Yikes..this is an angry article. The trouble with so much anger is that it gives the other side more amunition to use and makes it difficult for non-partisan readers to understand the facts.<br/>In many ways, I think the issues are far larger than the debate around vaccination. We have lost trust in our government and lost trust in the idea that our government will protect us. Why has this happened? Because we have been lied to about the existence of weapons of mass destruction and lead into a war that never ends. We are also regularly lied to about the influence of corporations in government decisions that effect our every day lives.  It is difficult to know who and what to believe and that can make us feel fearful.<br/>We have always been a culture that puts the individual above the group. I don't think that the cowboy mentality works well in a developed civilization but focus on the individual seems to be part of what fuels the us against them mentality. <br/><br/>We have traveled all over the world and seen how the lack of access to some vaccine devastates the young and elderly. We think that it would be an act of pure selfishness to not vaccinate our children. However, that doesn't mean that we agree to vaccinate our children on the time table laid out by the physicians nor do we choose to use every new vaccine that comes on the market. Science is far from perfect and so with new vaccines we take a wait and see approach unless it is a matter of safety for our children or community.",,,,,,,
"There are sefveral issues here.<br/><br/>First, the arguments of the anti-vaccine crowd have become somewhat more nuanced.  On one point they have a legitiamte gripe.  They argue that there is will eventually be vaccines for 100's of rare diseases and subjecting children to that many shots is, at a minimum, traumatizing.  I agree.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, such a reasoned and common sense position is not representative of most of their thinking.  If you push them far enough regarding the science behind their claims, most will say, ""I don't care about your science and research.  I don't want my kids vaccinated.""<br/><br/>If we translate this, it basically means, ""I have a right to be as crazy and stupid as I want to be.""<br/><br/>To which I say, ""That is a most unfortunate and irresponsible choice for your children but I guess you do have that right.""  But I would add that the right to be stupid does not come with the right to impose your stupidity on me and my children or the community at large.  Therefore, you have to homeschool your children.<br/><br/>And here is where we run into real problerms with this crowd.  For the most part, they don't want to play the game that way.  They don't want the shots and they do want to subject others to their stupidity.<br/><br/>As to the issue with Big Pharma, does this apply to all drugs produced by these companies?  Vitamins?  Diabetes medication?  Blood pressure medicine?  No, those drugs are somehow held to a different standard.  <br/><br/>Kudos to Governor Brown.",,,,,,,
"California probably needs a law compelling ""almost all schoolchildren to be vaccinated"" for everyone's health and safety - but especially that of children. <br/><br/>But no enlightened political progressive would regard such a last-ditch measure as ""progressive."" <br/><br/>""Progress"" in history has followed a fundamental underlying pattern: negative measures intended to force people either to do things (coercion) or to stop people doing socially proscribed things (punishment) have been gradually replaced with incentives to do important things (such as religious observance, ""creating"" economic goods, or being a good citizen) and to refrain from doing other, ""bad"" things.  <br/><br/>Ending the coercive and punitive threats of a monarch was a basic reason for a famous document Americans celebrated yesterday. Coercion-fixated ""progressives"" like Jerry Brown evoke memories of that monarch.   <br/><br/>A progressive way of getting the cooperation of caregivers - the final decision-makers on what will or will not happen to children in their care -  would not focus on the ""quick and dirty"" passing of coercive laws like the one Mr. Bruni endorses in this Sunday Review.  A progressive way might begin with a carefully planned program of positive public health education. <br/><br/>Also, the scientific truth about the safety of vaccination is not ""the consensus of scientists"" - that is to say, what scientists believe  - but how and why they hold those beliefs.  Those ""hows"" and ""whys"" would be essential to such a program. ",,,,,,,
"How about requiring immunizations for all pubic &amp; private schools. For those who claim religious exemptions, let them send their kids to religious schools OR home-school their kids.( I question the ability of parents to home school and I wonder what genius thought it appropriate.) My 4 children were all vaccinated with no dire consequences. Who thinks up these ideas?",,,,,,,
"Maybe you have to be as old as I to see the profound effect vaccines have had. <br/><br/>The terror of polio, which afflicted many of my childhood friends and their families was devastating. Kids were routinely kept away from each other out of a very real fear of contracting the disease. Like everyone else in my town, we were linked by fear of disability or death. Jeanie, Doug, Greg, Kathy, Anne...just five of the kids I knew who survived polio, but not the devastation that came with it. I clearly remember standing in the kitchen with my mother when the announcement came on the radio that there was finally a polio vaccine. My mother just put her head down and sobbed.<br/><br/>A few years later, a major measles epidemic hit my town. Our school was closed for a month; my best friend died. Others I knew were left with varying degrees of hearing loss and long and short-term disabilities.<br/><br/>With all the shouting about vaccines there is too little discussion of why we have them. I do not have to imagine a world without immunization. I saw it.",,,,,,,
"The anti-vaccine nuts are ""upscale"" (have money) but they are not educated.  They work in jobs (entertainment, typically) that do not require education.  They coasted through school and college taking easy, feel-good, courses that did not teach or require quantitative or critical thinking.",,,,,,,
"Even if getting vaccinated is the sensible thing, which it usually is, it is not right to force parents to vaccinate their children. <br/><br/>Rather, parents should be allowed to opt their children out.  But it should not be a trivial process. That way, only a very few children will not get vaccinated. <br/><br/>I am more afraid of our creating a totalitarian state, little by little, than I am of the risks posed by a few kids who aren't vaccinated. <br/><br/>BTW, I am a scientist involved in mathematically modeling diseases and resistance. So I understand the scientific issues involved. <br/><br/>However, the vaccination controversy isn't a scientific one; it is about balancing governmental powers and freedom. We do not want to go down the path of ""if it saves one life we must do it"" since that path leads to totalitarianism. ",,,,,,,
"While it has been fully proved that vaccines do not cause autism, enough anecdotal information exists to realize that there likely is some sort of correlation (again, NOT causation) between vaccines and autism. One theory is that the use of acetaminophen to treat the fever that often develops after a vaccines might actually heighten the risk of autism because acetaminophen wipes out most of the body's glutathione (the body's master antioxidant) within minutes. This is important because glutathione plays a critical role in the immune system's ability to respond to threats, including from vaccines, and thus might trigger or increase the chances of developing the disease in a child already predisposed to autism. Interestingly, in Cuba, a country where acetaminophen is very rarely used to treat children (aspirin is preferred), autism rates are a fraction of those in the US. <br/><br/>Sadly, much of the medical community resists considering any correlations such as this one because it rightly fears that most people do not understand the difference between causation, correlation and catalysts and will assume that any statements that link autism in any way to vaccines, even when not due to a causal relationship, will be misinterpreted and seen by anti-vaxxers as a validation of their crusade. This would damage the credibility of medical organizations in the eyes of a significant part of the public and lend credence in the future to more quackery and mistrust of sound scientific fact.",,,,,,,
"I get the polio vaccine. Polio was a holy terror.  But the mumps, measles, German measles? I had them all as a kid in the sixties and am no worse for it. Of course some will have lasting effects, but what are the lasting effects of pumping people full of vaccines, I mean the effect over generations. Has that been researched? As I see it, the problem these days is with two parent working families: there is no one home to can take care of a sick kid for a week. ",,,,,,,
"Every day each of us is exposed to literally thousands of different bacteria, viruses and fungi that don't make us sick.  Why?  Our immune system fights them off.  (That is the reason we don't rot when we're alive).  Unfortunately, there are some bacteria and viruses our immune system aren't as good at fighting off when we're first exposed to them or are harder to fight off when the immune system is young.  Vaccines protect against just a few of these.  When looked at from the context of how many pathogens our immune system  fights on a regular basis, vaccines are just a drop in the bucket to the immune system.<br/><br/>As for the timing--you want to start vaccines to certain diseases as soon as the immune system is able to respond to them, some around age 2 months.  For example, whooping cough, haemophilus influenzae type b (causes meningitis), pneumococcus (also causes meningitis) and rotavirus (causes severe vomiting and diarrhea) are all diseases that naturally peak or are especially severe during the infant or toddler years without vaccination.  ",,,,,,,
"These vaccines have been in use around the world for decades and their safety has been carefully studied and is now well established.  While the risk of an allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine is one in a million, other, more severe reactions, are so rare that it's not clear that they were even caused by the vaccine.  On the other hand, while you weren't harmed by these childhood diseases, about one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.",,,,,,,

"Among my earliest scary memories is the polio epidemic‚Äîin California, a neighbor's illness and death in 3 days, and that family's son in an iron lung the rest of his life. A lifetime of disability for survivors, a lifetime of caregiving for their families. I've just come through 3 months-plus of whooping cough/pertussis, evidently having outlived the DPT vaccine and likely having caught it at a multi-generational family gathering. If I'd been my mother-in-law‚Äîfrail at 89, with lung damage from long-ago radiation‚Äîodds are I'd have suffered far more discomfort and pain than I did, plus broken ribs, perhaps a very painful death. In the 1950s, our neighbor's family paid for a lack of knowledge; we learned from the deaths and suffering of many others, and the research of doctors Salk and Sabin and their colleagues‚Äîthey were an army and they prevailed, as did Lister against infection in the previous generation. We wiped out polio; we thought we'd wiped out pertussis; hell, we thought we'd wiped out measles. There's no excuse this time except arrogance and passing along bad/wrong info. It would be more life-giving to fight for [clean] water preservation in California and elsewhere than to fight vaccines and the resulting herd immunity, from which many anti-vax adults have benefitted. Fight for addiction treatment, RFK Jr.  Or mental health. Or childhood nutrition. This is willful anti-science from educated privileged people. Their grandchildren will not thank them. Nor will mine.",,,,,,,
"Mr. Bruni, my problem with your op ed piece is that you are unwilling to listen to the opposite viewpoint.  I thought journalists were supposed to at least drop their biases, at least for a moment, and consider both sides.  You obviously have not done that.  If so You would have given Mr. Kennedy some of your time.  You see, the majority of those people fighting against unsafe vaccines are the hundreds of thousands of parents with autism, or the hundreds who saw their daughters permanently damaged from the HPV  vaccine  or those who saw their babies seize following their vaccinations.<br/>It's obvious you ae not one of those parents.  If you don't believe that  lage corporations run America then youneed to change jobs.

Polio victims quite visible, common and a horrifying fate to be avoided all costs.",,,,,,,
"As a scientist, I see the anti-vax movement as an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect writ large. Anti-vaxxers get their information from sources that peddle lies and pseudoscience, but in order for them to know this, they'd have to know how to recognize pseudoscience. They don't, so they fall for it.<br/><br/>You can't show them information from places like the CDC or the NIH, because a Dunning-Kruger wall surrounds them and blinds them to it. I expect that most of these people honestly believe that vaccines contain deadly poisons like ""buffers""  and aluminum.  No matter that vaccine buffers are salt water, and that there's more aluminum in breast milk. Dunning-Kruger is there insulating them from reality while making them feel ""educated.""<br/><br/>And as for Wakefield's fate and all the studies showing that vaccines don't cause autism, Dunning-Kruger helps people believe that it's all a conspiracy bought and paid for by Big Pharma. Clearly, no anti-vaxxer has bothered to calculate just how much money Big Pharma would have to be spending to pay off NIH, the CDC, the journals, the UK medical licensing board, everyone else who's ever said that vaccines are safe, and even Wakefield's own co-authors.  Suffice to say that Big Pharma's payoff debt would make Greece's debt look like chump change. <br/><br/>The only cure is for schools and universities to do properly teach students about the scientific method and how to spot unreliable sources of information (that, and good, solid vaccination laws).",,,,,,,

"This is a very shrill column.  The statement that people who have concerns about the safety of vaccines are climate change deniers and the usual invocation of Jenny McCarthy are two examples of how pro-vaccine people use exaggeration and create ""straw men"" to easily discredit and mock anyone who takes a different position on these issues.  This sarcastic column implies that any research that might suggest some problems with vaccines is extremist nonsense.  In fact, there are plenty of examples of credible experts who have raised questions about ingredients in vaccines and other safety issues.  I noticed Mr. Bruni failed to mention the Vaccine Court.  Many people who have concerns with Vaccines are educated, health-conscious, concerned for health and civil liberties--and yes, very concerned about the reality of Climate Change and not easily swayed by extreme conspiracy theories.  We could have a much healthier debate than this. Very disappointing column.",,,,,,,
"I think we have entirely too much science going on these days.

Bruni, who can wield a scalpel of logic much better than most writers, gives valuable advice about discerning the difference between authoritative evidence and hysterical dilettantism.<br/><br/>Shame on Robert Kennedy Jr. for his arrogance in not recognizing how irresponsible he is to assume that highly trained and dedicated physicians and researchers from the best academic medical centers around the world have missed or, worse, have hidden proof of a causal connection between vaccinations and autism. What conceit it must require for Kennedy to believe that he, untrained in the field, has discovered the answers.",,,,,,,
"Yes, the column is not in the usual Bruni style. Mr. Bruni often writes from a very personal viewpoint, and when he does, his best columns present him as a representative of a much larger group, which makes what has happened to him personally relevant to many or most other readers, this reflected in the comment section. In this case, I doubt most readers have gotten indignant over an overly-pushy Kennedy, insistently calling them and annoying them. I know Bobby, Jr. has never called me. Is all of that plot detail really useful in the discussion of vaccination? Having said that, I applaud Gov. Brown's decision on the substance of the issue. In the response I am replying to, I read a reference to ""plenty of examples of credible experts"" without presenting the name of a single one among the plenty. As for the matter of the support of educated people for the anti-vaccination argument, well, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton are pretty well educated and they voted to give former Pres. Bush virtually unlimited power in dealing with Iraq. This turned out to be a position some would have ascribed to a stereotypical uneducated person. We have virtually wiped out childhood diseases that had been debilitating or even ending the lives of many people before those vaccines were available. It is not surprising that there are also possible dangers. It is analogous to the benefits cars provide though they can result in deaths that would, for example, not be caused by people riding bicycles.",,,,,,,
"A few comments.  <br/><br/>1st, the reason for early vaccines - children are most vulnerable under 1 year of age.  That's when most kids died before immunizations were available.  <br/><br/>2nd, vaccines are either small fragments of germs or are weakened strains and fool the body into producing antibodies that protect against the truly dangerous strains.  Even if they cause illness, it is minimal compared to the real thing.  <br/><br/>3rd, vaccines have become progressively purer over the last 30 years.<br/><br/>Here are the numbers:<br/>Today, up to age 6, we vaccinate for 14 different diseases.  Some (H. flu) have only 1 strain.  Some have 3 (Polio).  Some have many (pneumococcus).  The total # of strains is roughly 28.<br/><br/>In 1980 when I finished my initial training, the total # of antigens in vaccines was about 15,000.  Then, we immunized for about 8 diseases.  Now, we protect against 14 diseases but the total # of antigens is less than 500.  <br/><br/>You correctly remember fewer vaccines but you were receiving FAR more material in those injections than you do now. 30 times more!  <br/><br/>Again - kids receive far fewer antigens now than they did in 1980 even tho' they get more shots.<br/><br/>I saw many children die of H. flu meningitis during training.  Most died in their first year.  The vaccine came out in the mid 80's and within 5 years, the disease was gone.  It was a miracle.  I daily thank the Lord for giving us these life-saving tools.<br/><br/>I hope this helps.",,,,,,,
"According to the CDC, 5.2% of kindergarten kids have not been vaccinated.  Of the unvaccinated, about one third are religious or philosophic opponents.  Most important, while the overall level of vaccination approaches the target rate, local areas where there are a disproportionate number of unvaccinated pose a substantial threat to public health.  <br/><br/>If you think about it, the CDC report suggests that those who refuse vaccination should be treated like sex offenders -- with their addresses publicized and provisions preventing them from living near each other.  I'd support that.",,,,,,,
"I have never been anti-vaccine.  All my children are vaccinated.  I generally except what the doctors tell me for myself and my children, and it has generally worked well for my family.  However, after reading your column, I am actually a little less sanguine about vaccines than I was before reading it.  First, I am generally suspicious of establishing truth by authority without any other evidence to back up the claims.  I doubt some grand conspiracy is taking place.  However, sometimes the experts are wrong without the need for a conspiracy.  Another point is that progress is sometimes stymied by vested interests.   <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I would probably default to my trust in the system, except that some of the points you make do not add up for me.  Why was  thimerosal ""removed from ‚Äî or reduced to trace amounts in ‚Äî most childhood vaccines.""  Was it a problem in the past?  Is it still a problem with those vaccines (not most) that still use it?  Yes, the anti-vaccine crowd apparently attracts a lot of melodramatic personalities, but citing their excesses is just a straw man argument.  Another problem is this column argues in effect that any criticism of the safety of vaccines is inappropriate, because it reduces confidence in vaccines at risk.  I find this de facto claim of infallibility troubling.",,,,,,,

However, I am really tired of being labeled an ""anti-vaxer"". <br/><br/>My father was a pioneer in bringing the Polio vaccine to Philadelphia in the early 1960's, and I think our generation of the 60's and 70's had something like 8 vaccines in a lifetime. Now the kids get 30+ vaccines. It is pretty simple, and this is America. We do great things like discover vaccines, but then we overdo it. In the case of my son, I have seen his immune system get overwhelmed by allergy testing (30+ shots in one sitting) when we were trying to ""make him better"". <br/><br/>I can't see how my statement makes me an ""anti-vaxer"". When I see studies on the cumulative effects of the 30+ vaccines, real independent studies, I will acknowledge that ALL 30+ vaccines are safe to administer with no concept of a schedule or spacing!<br/><br/>And yes, I am an over-educated Ivy league and Jesuit educated graduate.

They don't realize that they are, on a daily basis, 'swallowing camels' with ease and then (with respect to vaccines) 'straining at mosquitoes'.

"No, Miriam, at 8 weeks you had the whole cell DPT. Depending on your age, you may have had the polio vaccine in school or in your doctor's office. But they were given also at 2, 4, 6, &amp; 18 months as well as a booster from 4-6 years of age.  And the whole cell vaccine had an enormous number of immunogens, far more than what children receive from all vaccines together. And the only reason we don't give the smallpox vaccine anymore is that we wiped the disease off the planet by universal immunization. BTW, it was given at one year of age. I also had a booster before heading to college. Measles, mumps and rubella have been given anywhere from 9-15 months of age. We give them at 6 months only when there is an outbreak cause by antivaxxers. Get your facts straight.",,,,,,,
"n addition to their toxic composition, the second problem with vaccinations is that they stimulate the wrong immune system. In my opinion, this is the greatest threat to our immune system that we have ever faced. You see, when a virus, parasites, or cancer cells threaten your body, they will activate an immune response called a Th1 (cell-mediated) response. This is your body‚Äôs first line of defense, which will then stimulate a Th2 response (humoral). The Th2 is an emergency response which produces antibodies that resolve inflammation so that healing can continue. The problem is that childhood vaccinations or flu shots stimulate the Th2 resonse, not the Th1, thus violating the natural sequence. This violation has serious consequences. First, when you stimulate a Th1 response, you produce a lifetime immunity; however, when you vaccinate, you need boosters every 3 to 5 years because the Th2 is stimulated first. In other words, you do not have a lifetime immunity.<br/>Today, 206,000 Americans under the age of 20 have type 1 diabetes, a well-known autoimmune disorder. The CDC reports that 1 out of 400 children and adolescents are now diabetic. ",,,,,,,
"I think that vaccinations against diseases like polio, smallpox and measles are truly the story of medicine at its best, of medicine working the miracles that so many of us hope it will eventually do with cancer and heart disease. You make a very valid point about anti-vaxers being climate-change deniers dressed in Prada. The luxury of saying ""no"" to a vaccine based on internet babble and scare tactics is just part of the whole over-parenting phenomenon that is truly disturbing because of the level of narcissim involved. I watched some interviews with anti-vacciners.The two most prevalent words I heard in these interviews were ""me"" and ""my."" Not one parent mentioned the fact that not vaccinating their own children might have a detrimental effect on other children. I was appalled.<br/>However, I think in the article you allowed yourself to be as strident and hyperbolic as you describe Mr. Kennedy to be. You gloss over the idea of ""big pharma"" as being an illusion when we all know that big pharma in the US is a very real and present danger. Doctors do prescribe medicines based on how much money they will receive from a pharmaceutical company to push their product. I was home sick one day watching TV and counted 25 ads for ""diseases,"" and pills to cure those diseases, from COPD to meningitis, to Alzheimers. At the end of the ad, they list the side effects. These ads are obcenities and give people good reason not to trust the medical establishment. Big medicine needs to get smaller.",,,,,,,

"   Timely article. Ignorance is insolent and full of prejudices. Of course, ignorance is remediable with eduication...unless we are talking about ""willful ignorance"", which has no remedy. Vaccinations have prevented infectious diseases for millions of children, and are very safe. Demanding absolute safety, or utopia, is stupidity personified. It is as if, for instance, you would expect a politician, like Chris Christie , to tell the experts what to do with 'ebola' (remember?). Conspiracy theories abound; it just so happens that Big Pharma has no interest whatsoever in preventing something they rather monetize with treatment. Vaccines are one of the miracles of science. Withholding vaccination by stupid parents is tantamount to child abuse, religious dogma notwithstanding.",,,,,,,

"As a pharmaceutical chemist and father of 4, I can assure you, there's no such thing as herd immunity.  If it existed, natural immunity among unvaccinated would impart it much better than any vaccine.  <br/><br/>Such a failure, Merck had to falsify their vaccine clinical data.  In 2012, a class action lawsuit ‚ÄîUnited States v.

The peer reviewed medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases proves the fallacy of herd immunity, writing, ""Other problems arise because herd immunity is not the same as biologic (immunologic) immunity; individuals protected only by indirect herd effects remain fully susceptible to infection, should they ever be exposed.""<br/><br/>I'll side with science, no vaccines for me or my kids.",,,,,,,

Which, sadly, won't help if an infected child goes to the zoo or a museum or movie theater.  <br/><br/>I understand that some pediatricians are refusing to treat children whose parents choose to not have them vaccinated.  The pediatricians believe that if an unvaccinated child is brought to their waiting room for diagnosis of an illness which may be a contagious disease for which there is a vaccination, that child endangers all the others in the waiting room who were not vaccinated because they are too young (infants) or have sound medical reasons for not being vaccinated, and the pediatricians choose to protect those patients from the deliberate risk-taking of the anti-vax parent. <br/><br/>It just occurred to me that another area of potential contamination from the un-vaccinated is the emergency room.",,,,,,,

"Yes, vaccination has indeed affected brains -- the brains of all those people who oppose vaccinations. Yes, there is a minimal risk connected with vaccination, which must be compensated if indeed there is serious injury form vaccination (it can happen, and it is very traceable). <br/><br/>As the father of an autistic child (Asperger, now in her thirties and living/earning on her own), I do not blame vaccinations, which are much older than the current wave of autism, but perhaps maternal stress during a successful premature delivery (3 months), frequent ultrasounds, and God knows what other influences during late pregnancy and her early childhood. Without 'modern science', she would have been dead; with 'modern science' she is alive, even though with problems. <br/><br/>Whatever ails my daughter started way before she got vaccinated. It is quite possible that the higher survival rate of problem pregnancies and the much higher rate of C-sections (with accompanying decrease of transfer of internal microorganisms from mother to child -- see recent article in NY Times) are responsible for the increased rate in autism. Let scientists find out what it is without endangering everyone by not vaccinating.

Not all feelings and concerns have any basis in reality. <br/><br/>Yep, there are more vaccines than you had when you were a kid. Kids are protected against more diseases than we were.<br/><br/>I think the major failure here is in explaining why we have these vaccines, what their limitations are and how we really do know that there isn't a link to autism.

"Yes, you make a very good point. There are reasons for parental concern and the number of cases of autism is skyrocketing. I do believe all children should be vaccinated, but this is not a black and white issue.

The vet could have, but didn't, give all of the shots at once because she didn't want to overwhelm my dog's system. Enough said.",,,,,,,
"I'd like to testify that if more parents saw how fast a disease can spread and how quickly you can loose your child, if they get that disease; they would be lining up for the vaccines! My son, when he was 3 1/2yrs old contracted spinal meningitis( 2yrs before the HIB vaccine was invented) and he almost died in a matter of hours. If not for antibiotics and quickly getting him to the hospital for that first spinal tap, he would not have made it. All the professional neighbors on our street had to take medication and witnessed the 2 terrifying weeks when we held our breath. So, when the HIB vaccine arrived a few years later, local parents could not line up fast enough with their children!(like the polio vaccine of my childhood). Happily that son is now a doctor, with two children of his own, who are also vaccinated. We live in a country where we rarely see the ravages of childhood disease. #getyourkidsvaccinated ",,,,,,,
"I cannot imagine a pediatrician who would be unwilling to space out vaccinations over a longer period if it were that or no vaccinations at all. Other concerns about environmental assaults are also understandable and can be heightened in new parents. But that's a separate issue from vaccinations. It's very telling that you say that the parents you speak of are ""concerned about overwhelming their children's immune system"", that they ""feel ....their children could be at risk"". Your feelings &amp; concerns are your business, but serious public health policy has to be made based on scientific fact. Not on anyone's feelings. Have any of these parents done any research to verify whether what they fear is based on reason? All the other concerns you cite....cell phone towers, GMO's, chemicals &amp; antibiotics in food, are all concerns that can be addressed without refusing to vaccinate your child. I cannot understand how you can conflate all these separate issues to justify denying a child protection from diseases that were, for generations, the most feared killers of the young. And I'd like to see some harder info about your allegation regarding Merck and the MMR. I have no illusions about the purity of the pharmaceutical industry, but making vague allegations about ""falsifying data"" about the MMR to justify refusing to vaccinate doesn't pass the sniff test.

I seems that the must vaccine people are always attacking a person like Mr. Kennedy. 49 vaccines by the time a child is 6. Think about that 49! And the hysteria about no vaccines is curious. 330 million people and couple of hundred cases of measles. And with the global world we have now you would assume their are many people traveling through and living in the US they have various or no innoculation. The immune system is an issue. And the crazy amount of doses makes no sense. And I ask this question. Why does the US Government have a Vaccine Court in Washington (giving the Pharma companies immunity) with thousands of claims. They have paid out millions for damages to children from vaccines. How many American's know about the court? I had the measles and I am 71. And very healthy. Common sense and compromise would work here.    ,,,,,,,
"We had our kids vaccinated.  We were not enthusiastic about having to have our younger child receive a newly developed vaccine against chicken pox (we were concerned that there hadn't been adequate time to bring any potential problems with it to light), but when the schools required it, I had him vaccinated.  I myself have gotten ill from vaccines, the small pox vaccination and the measles vaccine in particular:  I was seriously ill for days after each of them, and my fever both times reached 105 degrees (after the measles vaccine, I had a fever of at least 103 for a week -- I was about 9 and the memory of that illness has stayed with me).  I also had a severe case of chicken pox as an adult, some years before there was a chicken pox vaccine on the market.  So for me, the issue of vaccination looks more like an informed cost-benefit analysis, neither the complete ""no brainer"" some people claim, nor something to be taken lightly and decided on the basis of false or unsubstantiated claims.  Some people see a conspiracy whenever they feel ""pushed"" into doing something by something like the government.  And the medical profession has been known to be wrong, for example in the prescription of DES to pregnant women.  Maybe we could reach some of the anti-vax people more effectively if we ratcheted down the rhetoric on both sides and discussed the issue more in terms of cost-benefit -- I can see that I get sick from vaccines but that they are still a good public health tool.",,,,,,,

"So the issue here is that the drug companies are getting the government to mandate their products for them.  This leads to a whole series of negative effects associated with fascism.  The manufacturer has no market discipline to incent it to provide value, safety, and efficacy.  If vaccine mandates were in place in most states 10 years ago, we would still have thimerosal in child vaccines.  It is only because of consumer pushback that we got it out.  The manufacturers should not be treated any different from any other competitive industry and accept full liability for death and injury.  The government should assure it is competitive and discretionary, so that consumers are free to choose from multiple manufacturers, or to choose not to vaccinate for particular diseases if no products suit them.  This would encourage the manufacturers to provide real value to win customers and to innovate by providing new methods of achieving and testing for immunization.

The billion dollar fines routinely levied against companies that illegally market drugs , the drugs that come off the market after they kills thousands, the studies showing drugs not working that never see the light of the day, the refusal to test natural substances like herbs against illness, the manipulation of studies by use of esoteric statistics, misleading questions, inappropriate study populations (often young healthy populations are tested on drugs that go to older sicker people) to show positive results, the tens of thousands who annually die from properly prescribed prescription drugs, and on and on. <br/><br/>Is it any wonder that many will never trust these companies and their allies?

"I am so glad science and common sense have prevailed! The appalling ignorance and selfishness of those who are willing to bring back 19th-century infant mortality to protect their children from the imaginary brain damage needs to be exposed for what it is. If you have an autistic child, it is not the result of vaccination or an auto-immune disease. Autism, in all probability,is a genetic disorder that starts in the womb - so if need somebody to blame, blame yourself. But infectious diseases are real and totally horrifying. I had mumps as a child because the USSR did not vaccinate against it, and it was no picnic!

Vaccination saves lives; ignorance kills. And no, I have no connection whatsoever to Big Pharma. I just know history.",,,,,,,
"Frank has it exactly right.  The high and mighty ""no vaccination"" people can only take that position because the majority uses good sense and gets their children vaccinated.  When I was growing up in the 50s, we all expected to catch the measles, German measles and chicken pox because there were no vaccines for these diseases as there was for small pox.  Fortunately, Dr. Salk had then identified the polio vaccine, which we all got, and none of us had to worry about getting polio, as children, including a boy a few years older than I was, living down the street, who had polio and subsequently walked with a limp, did.  I never questioned getting vaccinated nor ensuring my children were vaccinated and they never suffered from any historic childhood disease.  <br/><br/>These vaccination deniers are simply relying that most people will vaccinate their children as the way to prevent their own children from catching these diseases.

"I'll go Miriam one better... for my older baby boomer generation, our medical history typically included the doc's notation 'NCD' - mumps, measles and chicken pox were considered the 'normal childhood diseases'. I'm pretty sure we only got vaccinated for polio and smallpox, and even those I don't think were as infants. As Miriam points out, the CDC vaccine schedule today, in terms of the number of vaccines and the age they're administered, does give one (or at least some of us) pause. Personally I'm satisfied with the studies showing no link between vaccinations and autism, or more correctly, that the earlier studies showing such a link have been discredited (given the enormous problem we have with reproducible research in science, the odds that a paper's findings can be replicated are about half as good as that they can't be). But that doesn't lessen the uneasiness about giving so many vaccines, some of which do contain mercury preservatives and aluminum adjuvants (adjuvants being what the noted immunologist Charles Janeway referred to as 'immunology's dirty little secret') at such young ages.

Anthropogenic climate change is real, thiomserol causing autism is not. Compared to the benefit of vaccines to humanity, the whole enterprise of modern medicine has been little more than a rounding error.  I'll watch your documentary, but the facts are the facts.  Bruni has the substantive facts correct.<br/><br/>People need to think about ALL medical interventions as a cost/benefit. There has been no single greater benefit that medicine has bestowed upon mankind than vaccines. That is the truth. Paralytic polio would kill or paralyze 1 million children per year in 1950.  2014 marked the third year in a row that not a single child worldwide was paralyzed by this virus. Even if there is some minuscule risk to vaccines (and there is only modest evidence for older formulations that there is), that risk is plainly worth the cost. <br/><br/>Viz: even though a given chemotherapy might make you nauseas, it also might cure your cancer.

In most, if not all cases, such immune stimulation occurs with no serious problems; indeed such stimulation is essential for the maturation of a vibrant and healthy protective immune system. Now, in the face of such intense stimulation, do you really think deliberate immunization with a few childhood vaccines is going to have an discernible adverse effect? ",,,,,,,

Fair enough.<br/><br/>But then the doctor said it's ""impossible""...he used that word...that the vaccine caused the illness.  Which pretty much blows all his credibility as a scientist.

If they were to try to manufacture medications to treat the illnesses these vaccinations help avert, they'd have to put big research dollars into that, followed by ad dollars, and it's not even known whether such medications would be effective - because they don't yet exist.<br/>Pseudoscience thrives when people feel unheard.

"Thank you, Mr. Bruni. Your thoughts on vaccines are most appreciated.<br/><br/>One bit of research most anti-vaccine activists fail to do is look at the available data bases of actual vaccine injuries. There has been a federally administered fund to compensate those injured by vaccines for about 30 years, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. <br/><br/>The enabling legislation recognized there was a very, very, very small population that was having bad reactions to vaccines and that those individuals and their families needed help with coping with these extremely unusual bad reactions to the mandated (or at least strongly encouraged) inoculations. <br/><br/>Over the history of the program, the record of injuries and payouts are vanishingly small when compared to the number of doses administered.

If you dive deeper into this issue you will find peer reviewed scientific articles raising concerning questions about vaccine safety and the effect of ingredients used in vaccines such as thimerosal (FDA has allowed vaccines can be labeled thimerosal free even though it is still used in manufacturing process). For example a study published in toxicology and Environmental Chemistry in September 2008 that compared vaccinated and unvaccinated boys with the hepatitis b vaccine found 9 times higher rate of developmental disabilities in vaccinated kids. The mainstream media has been quick to assert that the science is conclusive while completely ignoring and discrediting interesting, good science raising legitimate questions about a number of questions regarding vaccine safety.

Most people should be able to understand what that means.<br/><br/>For example, the prevalence of ASD is continuing to increase in Iceland among children born after thimerosal was removed from vaccines there. The prevalence of ASD in Iceland is comparable to ASD prevalence in the US despite that children in Iceland receive fewer vaccines--given on a delayed schedule compared to the recommended schedule in this country--they do not receive influenza vaccines (which sometimes contain thimerosal,) and they are not vaccinated against Hepatitis B.

"Concerned Citizen, I have never told people they had to eat paleo, or any other diet. That being said, the paleo diet affects only you. Depriving your children of vaccination risks both them and others in the population. Society therefore has every right to require vaccination and little to require that anyone choose a diet.<br/><br/>Also, you overlook the fact that the Paleolithic diet is the historical diet of our species. To call that diet unproven is, well, silly.<br/><br/>The *only* diet that has been shown to extend lifespan in a controlled experiment is the Mediterranean Diet. The others haven't been tested.<br/><br/>You ware wrong that we don't have a pretty good idea of what paleolithic people ate.<br/><br/>That being said, I lost 70 pounds on paleo and went right to my ideal weight. My blood work was better than ideal, something it had not been on a typical American diet. I don't need no study to understand that!<br/><br/>Your posts in the past indicate that you don't know very much about what paleo is, or its justifications, and this comment of yours suggests to me that you don't even know what I've said on the topic.",,,,,,,
"Vaccines are given for the greater good of the whole.  The majority of people who receive a vaccination against a particular disease will be protected against that disease, and lives will be saved, and health care costs reduced as a whole.  As with all pharmaceuticals, a small minority will have an adverse reaction to a given vaccine.  A compromised immune system (even temporary) or an underlying genetic condition can contribute to a person having an adverse reaction to vaccination.  The DPT vaccine was changed to an acellular version, because there was a higher than average adverse reaction to the Pertussis portion of the vaccine for some.  I am certainly not anti -vaccination.  I would, as a scientist who taught medical microbiology at university, like to see more oversight of the pharmaceutical companies and more verification of their research results across the board, to insure vaccines are not only safe, but effective.  If a vaccine is not as efficacious as it should be, not only is the person receiving the vaccine not fully protected, but those who have adverse reactions to vaccination and cannot be vaccinated, are at risk of exposure to the disease being vaccinated against.  Adverse reactions are important considerations where vaccines are concerned, but effectiveness is a very important aspect as well.",,,,,,,

Your weekly column in the NYTimes does not bestow upon you any real scientific credentials either.<br/><br/>To act like government agencies and Big Pharma couldn't possibly have a made a huge mistake (even without invoking a conspiracy) in the vaccine schedule they are trying to enforce is certainly a pollyanna approach.  Here are some facts:  Mercury in all its forms is the most potent neurologic poison that we know of, perhaps as much as 1,000 times more poisonous to neurons as lead.  That same CDC has also stated there is no ""safe amount of lead"" that children can be exposed to.  Therefore there should be no safe amount of mercury that a child can be exposed to.  And yet for for about 20 years that same CDC recommended the accelerated vaccine schedule alluded to by the previous commenter and until parents raised all holy hell about it, all those vaccines contained mercury.  With your impeccable scientific credentials, Frank, please reconcile how these august government agencies not only allowed that, but promoted it.  If mercury didn't outright cause autism, the very best you can say for it is that it very likely, if not certainly, impaired the intellectual capability of every child that received it.",,,,,,,

"What troubles me about Bruni's column is not the conclusion reached, but the unscientific method used to get there. Apparently, the ""pro-vaccine side"" is right because that's the scientific consensus of the CDC, AAP, AMA, etc. The whole enterprise of evidence-based medicine is to move us away from reliance on consensus statements like expert panels, standards of care and other forms of polling. Science is not supposed to be a popularity contest; it's supposed to be about looking at the evidence. If the scientific consensus said that homosexuality is a disease requiring treatment or that the solution for obesity is to eat trans-fat-containing margarine, would Bruni support that because it was the consensus?<br/>In this instance, there is an opportunity to educate the public about the science of how we know if something in the environment causes disease. The basic way to do that would be using the Hill causality criteria, which come  from trying to figure out if smoking caused lung cancer. Mercury causing brain damage meets the criterion of biological plausibility, but then one could go through the other criteria for thimerosal and autism and see where the evidence points.<br/>I think it's good that the Times has a new policy of not giving equal time to ""both sides"" on matters of settled science. But, somehow we're still just framing things as opinion debates instead of looking at verifiable facts. Faith in scientists is unscientific.",,,,,,,

When I asked why, I was told parents may not bring the kid back to  the make all appointments and the child needs vaccination.  Frankly that's barbaric, holding a one year old down for five needles, and not a practice I will utilize for my patients.  All that being said, it is not unrealistic to wonder if  there  is something in the environment that is causing a huge increase in autism diagnoses.

As I noted in another post that may or may not have run, my sister, born in 1948, didn't get the 'autism' diagnosis until the 1980s. For most of her life she had a range of other diagnostic labels.

"No, you are incorrect.  No form of mercury is safe in any amount, just like lead is not safe in any amount--injected intramuscularly, inhaled, ingested orally or absorbed through the skin.  All of it is neurotoxic--that not only includes the organic form in fish, methylmercury, but also the non-organic form in thimerosal.  Bruni is incorrect when he implies that the mercury used in vaccines was ever safe. Because mercury used to be used in dental fillings doesn't mean it was safe.  Because we used to put lead in gasoline and paint doesn't mean that was safe either.   In the 1930s a teething powder for infants was widely popular, it had mercury in it, and caused a devastating syndrome caused ""Pink's disease"" (acrodynia). But that hardly justifies ever having put mercury in that either.  We used to do a lot of stupid things before we knew better. Thimerosal may not have caused the autism epidemic, but it is still be a very toxic ingredient that should never have been put in vaccines. And it's neurotoxicity was well known when they started putting it in vaccines.  That's the part that people like Bruni and so many others are missing, and for which the CDC roundly deserves condemnation. For heaven sakes, even Russia (hardly an  oasis of advanced medical care) stopped putting thimerosal in vaccines decades ago.  Mercury actually has not been removed from all vaccines.  It is still commonly found in flu vaccines and in Rhogam vaccines.  ",,,,,,,

Mr. Bruni has ingested the ""there's no evidence that.."" and the ""scientific studies prove..."" kind.<br/>Big Pharma has earned its reputation for greed and deception, and we should all be skeptical about the medicines we take.

Remember how Agent Orange didn't cause disease, and those toxic dumps in Iraq weren't harming the soldiers who sickened from them? Remember when lead in our gasoline and paint was considered harmless? When cigarettes were good for you? Thalidomide, and Tylenol, which can lethal liver damage? It turns out that Aspirin can be deadly too, though we didn't hear about that from Bayer.<br/>Until someone comes up with an explanation for the sharply increased incidence of autism, allergies, and obesity, I'll be skeptical of ""scientific studies."" As for vaccinations, the odds are in their favor. While accepting that some children may be harmed, the harm from the diseases they prevent is much greater.

And an Italian court  decided a child was hurt by a vaccine because of a genetic sensitivity to aluminum and mercury (the latter not in US vaccines). <br/><br/>Yes, let's vaccinate our kids - it prevents the most harm.

They are taking nuanced positions. The Times interviewed a local mother here on the subject, and then wrote a front page article completely distorting her comments and taking them out of context. THAT is a lot of what I am concerned about, the distortions in the press that have turned my normally easy going county into an armed camp on the subject.

"The existence of that indemnification fund is often used as a point against vaccine producers. But the fund was established to keep manufacturers from going out of the vaccine business because of the risk of a few high-profile anomalous cases. It's easy for a personal-injury lawyer to bamboozle a jury with a sob story about a child -their first, understandable instinct is pity; they want to help, and would want so regardless of the culpability or lack of it of the defendant; and so they find for the plaintiff and throw money. (The defense, by contrast, can't fill the room with millions of children who not only were not injured by the vaccine but were prevented from contracting serious diseases, because you can't prove a negative.)<br/>I don't love the medical profession. I've been critical of so-called Big Pharma (I hate that brainless cant phrase) on many issues. But vaccines are an example of them doing something right. It's ironic that in the Third World they want these vaccines - just as it's ironic that the crunchy-granola upscale mommies so concerned with their kids' health are producing children allergic to every known foodstuff, while the peanuts those kids can't even be on the same tectonic plate with - peanuts we Boomers thrived on - are, in the form of a super-nutiritious paste called 'plumpynut', saving lives in Africa. Really, if you had to be born today, Uganda would be a better choice than the Upper East Side, in terms of modern medicine. Sigh. ",,,,,,,
"As the parent of a child with severe autism, I take issue with Mr. Bruni's dismissal of those who question the safety of vaccines.  He characterizes them as narcissists and free-riders, but his own rhetoric is overdone and inappropriately mean-spirited.   As long as the large increase in autism rates remains unexplained (currently one in 8 children in the U.S. come within the diagnosis of autism), the possibility that vaccines play a role should not be completely dismissed.  The concerns of parents should not be ridiculed and, in any case, Mr. Bruni has not persuasively made the case that all concerns about vaccines are wrong.<br/><br/>Today children receive 48 vaccine antigens in 34 injections from birth to age 6 (compared to 4 antigens in about 5 or 6 injections when I was a child).  I agree with Miriam of San Rafael that the large number of vaccines and the age at which they start is the concern.  Most researchers believe that autism results from a genetic predisposition meeting an environmental trigger.   The issue is simply: could the administering of vaccines to children be a trigger in some cases?  No large-scale, randomized control study comparing a group of vaccinated children to an unvaccinated control group has been carried out because medical ethics do not allow such a study.   I would welcome a follow up column that addresses the current research on this issue.",,,,,,,
"I remember receiving the sugar cube vaccine in the early '60s (talk about sugar coating the issue - sorry for the pun) as well as other various shots - kids in my elementary school were lined up by the hundreds to receive the vaccines.  But I was in the primary grades when this occurred.  I wonder if a correlation exists between infants receiving vaccinations and developing autism vs. pre-school aged kids receiving vaccinations and not developing autism.<br/><br/>For me the bottom line and no brainer answer is to have kids vaccinated to prevent any kind of epidemic.  Even if worried parents want to home-school their kids, un-vacced kids pose a real threat to everyone else.  <br/><br/>There is absolutely no reason for any of these diseases to still exist today.  Scared parents are taking us back into the dark ages.",,,,,,,
"For most things, I fully support the right of parents to make their own decisions on what they want to do in regard to their own children.<br/><br/>Vaccination is the one exception to this. I am admittedly very hard-nosed on this particular issue.<br/><br/>I believe it should be illegal not to vaccinate your kids. The ONLY exception that there should be to this is if the child has a medically verifiable condition that makes vaccination unsafe for that individual.<br/><br/>Telling the vaccine holdouts that they can home-school their children, and yet still enjoy things like the beach, parks, etc., where the rest of the public gathers, only shifts the problem to another dimension. You don't get to play Russian roulette with the lives of other people. When you don't vaccinate, that's what your doing. <br/><br/>Our world has gotten so small that diseases that once seemed to be relegated to the third world can now be found only one or two blocks over from you in most cities. And when your little darling encounters polio, or measles, or any of those kinds of diseases, they will get mowed down just like the millions of other ""healthy"" kids have before them. Folks, this is the reason that vaccines were invented! A service, by the way, that Congress practically has to twist the arms of vaccine makers to provide because the vaccine makers lose so much money on it! <br/><br/>How on earth can you willingly risk your child's health, and those of other innocent people, when a solution is so readily available???? <br/><br/>Disgusting!",,,,,,,

"Anybody who doesn't want their kids vaccinated can homeschool.  And, keep their kids (and themselves) away from other people because people with compromised immune systems that can't be vaccinated could be exposed to anything your kids haven't been vaccinated against.  You're free not to vaccinate, but you're not free of the consequences, and they don't all fall on you.  I had measles in 1950.  The doctor came to the house, said I had to be kept in a darkened room, use soda baths for the incredible itching, isolate from others.  The risk of visual impairment was high.  I ended up with bad vision, bad enough to require coke-bottle bottom glasses.  I would have preferred to have an immunization, if there had been one available.  In the early 1950s, people were scared of polio and were grateful when an immunization was developed.  But, we see people such as Miriam from San Rafael (below) who is afraid of practically everything.  It must be hard to fear cell phone towers, EMFs, GMOs, chemicals in food, too many ultrasounds (?), antibiotics exposure.  So, Miriam, you sound intelligent but you're letting yourself be overwhelmed by fear and maybe even paranoia.  So, don't vaccinate your kids, but keep them home with you and don't go out or you might be exposed to some sort of radiation or something.  Maybe there's something about Marin County that makes people have a herd immunity to facts.  ",,,,,,,

"Here are some reasons why gluten-avoidance is threatening (but not ""so"" threatening) to the non-celiac suffering of the rest of us:  <br/><br/>1.  My friend, who teaches in an elementary school in a liberal and pricey neighborhood in New York City, must screen all birthday-party baked goods that come into his classroom to confirm the gluten freedom of the goods, because about a third of the parents think they are doing their non-celiac suffering kids a favor.  My friend has enough to do without policing baked goods for no medically sound reason.<br/><br/>2.  In some cases, gluten-free packaged goods now carry a premium price and have replaced, not supplemented, the market for comparable goods that are not gluten-free.<br/><br/>3.  The gluten-free craze promotes an unsound idea, improving the ""market"" for unsound ideas.  Gluten is about as dangerous to people who don't have celiac disease as vaccinations are to people who do not have compromised immune systems.  The gluten-free craze enriches the soil for unsound ideas to grow in.  The anti-vaccination craze is actually life-threatening.  Gluten is not.<br/><br/>4.

Surprisingly, Chipotle is one restaurant they can patronize without any problems. I also have a relative with life-threatening fish allergies but she always carries an epi-pen with her. I think the disdain most people feel isn't against true allergies and celiac, it is linked to the fervor of anti-vaccine, anti-GMO and anti-gluten activists who dont know the science that refute their claims.",,,,,,,
"First world countries have the luxury of access to a large amount of a variety of foods, whether rich or poor. Third world countries, where starvation is prevalent, any available food source, whether it be sliced bread and peanut butter or a banana, can be a life saver.

Quit worrying about micromanaging every aspect of your diet. ",,,,,,,
"Perhaps the most common misconception is that a child‚Äôs immune system can be ‚Äúoverloaded‚Äù if the child receives multiple vaccines at once. This concern first began to appear as the recommended childhood immunization schedule expanded to include more vaccines, and as some vaccines were combined into a single shot. However, studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the recommended vaccines are no more likely to cause adverse effects when given in combination than when they are administered separately.<br/>Delaying vaccinations puts children at risk of contracting preventable diseases.",,,,,,,
"Dr. Carroll--<br/>To suppress the biological mechanisms of addiction or appetite, and/or  issues of self care such as exercise, a person's behavior can be modified by cash.  You propose that we should take a societal perspective to get past misgivings.   <br/><br/>""Societal perspective"" is the important term in this argument. The remedy of cash is a logical one from a societal perspective, shifting money from treatment for illnesses to prevention. it is logical from a provider- patient perspective- to help someone avoid  life changing, irreversible impacts on health.<br/>But I think it is a very thin line that separates these good intensions from something I find repellant, namely, changing a person into a creature to be manipulated by ""societal perspectives."" <br/><br/>The cash is basically a reward pellet and the person has been transformed into a creature to be manipulated for the economic betterment of society.  This is distinct  from imposing rules on vaccination, where one person's decision directly impacts the community's safety.  The cash will not remove the biological drive and the intrusive thoughts for drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, food. It has an effect on the person's humanity that is not altogether beneficent. It is another short step for society to impose this on people who are outside norms, with a penalty for those who decline.  I think an important measure of your proposal is-- would you like this imposed on you so that you would be more pleasing to society? ",,,,,,,

"DIAGNOSIS Is not a democratic process.  Nor a popularity contest. Neither is the prescribing of medical interventions.  While I'm in favor of establishing doctor-patient trust and working relationships, which may include discussion of the diagnosis and interventions, I stop short of the politicization of the diagnostic process.  Diagnosis must be based on empirical evidence, not subject to a vote or a popularity contest.  If parents mistakenly believe that their children will be safer with out vaccinations, then they must be helped to understand that by refusing to protect their children, they are engaging in medical neglect.  There have been cases where Christian Scientist parents who oppose blood transfusions have been court-ordered to have children given blood as a life-saving measure.  So there is precedent for having parents ordered to provide medical treatments (i.e., vaccinations) that will protect their children from deadly childhood diseases.  Debating the facts is beside the point.  The rights of children to receive the prevailing standard of medical care if the point at question.  Further, the rights of children in the classes with unvaccinated peers are being exposed to unnecessary medical risk that favor those who deny their children adequate medical care.  I stand firmly with the empirical evidence of the efficacy of vaccination in protecting children.  They also protect seniors against flu, which is one of the major killers of the elderly.",,,,,,,
"Vaccines safe for children?<br/><br/>I am currently reading ""Plagues and peoples"" by William H. McNeill. In this book McNeill observes that when an epidemic hits a population that has had little if any prior experience of the particular disease, the population suffers tremendously, but with repeated exposure to the disease less and less of the population suffers and the disease becomes what is known as endemic and the symptoms of the disease change and that diseases we now know as childhood diseases (measles, mumps, etc.) had greater virulence, damage in the past.<br/><br/>My interpretation is that Western society has become so health conscious, so safety oriented that we not only seek medicine to prevent epidemics we seek to prevent even experience of the endemic and relatively harmless childhood diseases which were rite of passage for many children in the past. This means vaccinations could have in spite of positive effects two clear negative effects: Allowing many children with clear genetic deficiency to exist who would have perished in the past by disease and compromising the immune systems of children who would pass safely through rite of passage of say, measles or mumps--which is to say much of the reason for so many allergies and so on today among American children is that they have excessively been sterilized with respect to natural environment, are excessively separated from microorganisms and would have been better off without vaccination and having undergone ""rite of passage"".",,,,,,,
"I see your point.<br/>But your missing the larger implication of your argument which demands also the following: Jail all smokers, and close down all tobacco producers as the morbidity to the public associated w second hand smoke far eclipses that of the diminished herd immunity caused by the non-vaccinated people. Outlaw the sale of simple carbohydrates and monitor their intake by children as their parents are clearly refusing to protect them from the current undisputed cause of morbidity and early death; childhood obesity. Take them away from parents if need be as the  empirical evidence resolutely demonstrates that doing so will add greatly to their health and lifespan. These two steps alone will improve public health  by many orders of magnitude than by forcing some outside the box thinking parents to do something w a needle to their kids that they would rather not do.

"The argument I was making is relatively simple. The overwhelming argument in medical community and in press is there is little which is negative if anything at all about vaccinations for even childhood diseases which cannot be classed as epidemic and dangerous such as bubonic plague. In short vaccinations are recommended for endemic diseases which have in no way had as negative an effect as epidemic diseases such as plague; the population of Europe and America, for example, was rising WITH endemic disease prior to modern vaccination.<br/><br/>In our day every little trace of disease must apparently be attacked whether by vaccination or sanitation of home. The question must be asked exactly why and why must negative effects of such not be expected when millions of people safely made it through a number of childhood diseases in the past. My belief is today we try to minimize as much suffering as possible, which is admirable, but apparently we have little courage to ask what exactly it means that vaccinated children are being vaccinated against diseases which they will in most cases live through...<br/><br/>I believe it a valid speculation to ask if all this vaccination, sanitation is not in fact messing up many people's immune systems and if we are in fact making a radical and unnatural separation between people and the natural environment. What effect this medical war against even microorganisms which probably cause relatively little harm? I am just questioning here. It should be obvious...",,,,,,,

"I agree that we overuse sanitizers and don't expose children to enough dirt, but we vaccinate against 12 childhood diseases, hepatitis A and B, influenza, and HPV. That's 16 diseases, all of which had serious risks of death or severe long-term complications (coma, paralysis, cancer), or posed a serious public health threat (hepatitis A).

"You know.......<br/><br/>Our family history is rife with several things: autoimmune issues (lupus, diabetes, psoriasis) and autism and ADHD. You will never convince me that there is zero link between the excess of vaccinations we give our kids and those diseases for folks with a genetic predisposition for inflammation and autoimmune problems. Now hold up, before you all attack me and let me explain.<br/><br/>I believe in vaccines. My children's vaccinations are up to date. <br/><br/>However. We slowed down the delivery of said vaccines. We did all the first year vaccinations even though they seemed excessive. However, when we got to varicella, MMR etc we waited until they were nearly 3. It was a mitigated risk because of herd immunity but also because they were home with me.<br/><br/>I think vaccines are likely safe for the majority of people---but for those of us with a predisposition to autoimmune disorders, proceeding judiciously with so many vaccinations on an underdeveloped immune system seems prudent. We don't do the flu vaccine, as an example, because it never seems to correlate with the current strain and it doesn't seem worth the risk. We are holding off on Garidisil until they are a little older--and its better understood.<br/><br/>We can't be militant about this--we don't know all the facts. We wish we did, but we don't.

I suggest that you look a little more deeply into how those 'plagues' are still with us.  Measles, polio, chicken pox, diphtheria, whooping cough are not innocuous, and many do not make it unscathed through that 'rite of passage'.<br/><br/>Until there is some proof, and to date there is NONE, that childhood vaccination somehow compromises a child's immune system for life, it is foolish to deny the health improvement and life saving benefits. To say nothing of the cost of treating hundreds of thousands of children and adults every year for preventable disease, and perhaps a life time of disability.<br/><br/>We don't know how the immune systems of people today compare to those of previous generations because nobody measured theirs. <br/><br/>Your statement ""Allowing many children with clear genetic deficiency to exist who would have perished in the past by disease.."" is horrific.

They are concerned w ""public health"". In this, the larger arena, there can be no comparison to the lives at risk. ""Public health"" has seen no threat from these few vaccine deniers like that of the threat from the issues I have outlined (and many I have not). There is simply no comparison. Public health officials attack the vaccine issue because they feel they can do so at no political risk, as opposed to attacking issues that will really save significant lives...the larger issues touched on above.

"Daniel12, your theories are based on a book written by a historian in 1976. I suggest you take a basic epidemiology class taught by some one from this century and learn WHY childhood vaccines are important. Vaccines do not destroy the immune system.

Not to mention the children who are immunocompromised and cannot be vaccinated‚Äî they have to be protected through herd immunity.",,,,,,,

"My question about vaccines is this: Prior to widespread vaccination humans suffered any number of epidemics such as plague--they took terrific toll. But not only enough humans survived through epidemics, populations were long used to coping with microorganisms which either did not have epidemic virulence to begin with or were epidemic at first but were gradually adapted to to the point of becoming endemic diseases, childhood diseases, killing not nearly as many people...In short people were having their immune systems stressed, exercised at best (by endemic disease) and at worst their immune systems were being overcome by epidemic disease such as plague.<br/><br/>Now doctors come along with vaccination against not only epidemic disease, disease which is clearly powerful such as plague, doctors recommend a host of vaccinations against the endemic childhood diseases through which millions of children lived (see rising population in Europe and America prior to vaccination). I believe it a legitimate question to ask if we are not with all the vaccinations and sanitation arriving at a situation of ""unexercised"" immune systems which go out of whack--a situation comparable to what an opiate addict does to pain system of body: If opiates are regularly introduced into body one becomes hooked, which is to say pain system of body is not exercised, and when opiates are withdrawn body, pain system recoils...The big question one of balance between vaccine and necessary exercise of immune system?",,,,,,,

"In all this happy talk about vaccinations, I find it very disturbing that not once has the NYTimes mentioned the existence of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Public Law 99-660) passed by the U.S. Congress in 1986. Since then over 2 billion dollars have been awarded to children and adults in cases of injury or death caused by vaccines. Injuries included brain damage (e.g., encephalitis), immediate anaphalactic shock, seizures, etc.<br/>In order to win uncontested federal compensation for a vaccine injury, a person must prove he or she developed certain clinical symptoms and medical conditions on the N.C.V. I. Table within a certain time frame of receiving a certain vaccine, and that there is no more biologically plausible explanation for the vaccine-related injury or death.<br/>N.C.V.I. was created because of pressure from vaccine manufacturers who were facing multimillion dollar lawsuits from parents of injured children. The act provides compensation via a federal trust, funded by a surcharge on every vaccination, and thus, protects manufacturers from any liability.<br/>One size does not fit all! Each individual will have a unique response to any given vaccine based on age, current health status, microbial makeup, etc. Some may have mild or no reactions, for others reactions can be devastating.

"This reflects lazy, condescending thinking. The Republicans may well assert themselves against Trump in a debate, but it won't be as a result of this rant.

While searching the science section, I saw an article that discussed the importance of a new vaccine created to help in an epidemic. It was intriguing to me because I was curious about how the process of developing a vaccine worked. Last year, an experiment for a vaccine was tested on Ebola in Guinea. Luckily, the vaccine was successful and provided protection 10 days after the injection. The president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Dr. Peter J. Hotez, stated ‚ÄúWe should have had an Ebola vaccine two or three years ago.‚Äù Ebola vaccines weren‚Äôt put in trials until the West African Outbreak last year. Shortly after the vaccine, the rate of the people with the disease decreased. Vaccines save thousands of lives. However, they are difficult to develop. Dr. Plotkin explained how designing experimental forms to test on plants and animals can cost $25 million dollars. Also, the researchers have to put the vaccine through many trials in humans. Dr Plotkin, Dr. Mahmoud, and Jerry Farrar issued a call for better ways to get vaccines through the pipeline quicker. In addition, they proposed the creation of a global vaccine-development fund. In conclusion, I learned a lot about vaccines and I have high hopes that researchers will continue to create more of them to help protect the world.",,,,,,,
"The Case for Fetal-Cell Research<br/>The author's purpose for writing this article was to explain that even though abortion is a very gross and cruel thing, many benefits come out of it. One benefit mentioned was that it can help with the making of vaccines. Even though one life was taken, it saved thousands of other lives. These are not just any vaccines either, they apparently are being made in the use of stem-cell therapies against diabetes, H.I.V, cancer, blindness, Alzheimer's, and heart disease. A good tactic that the author used to pinpoint his opinion was adding in a personal experience to the article. It lets the reader know that the author is not just writing about something because others believe in it, but because he has personally experienced it himself. The way the delivery of the fetal tissue in the  ‚Äúplain white FedEx box‚Äù was described showed how hard the job is of handling that kind of thing. It made everyone feel a bit uneasy, but all that could be said was that the abortion would have happened either way and if it was not put to use, then it would become trash. Researched or not, the women would have carried out with the abortion and there was nothing they could do about it then. However, it did seem as if the author began to criticize how women end pregnancies which did irk me a bit. It may be a disturbing thought of ending a baby‚Äôs life before it is even born, but that was the women‚Äôs decision and it should be respected. ",,,,,,,

"Experimental Ebola Vaccine Tested in Guinea Shows Promise, Report Says<br/><br/>Considering the abundance of resources available to me and so many other Americans, it is difficult to imagine the depth of grievance experienced by impoverished communities extant today. Recent developments combatting Ebola remind me of this unfortunate irony: that those most capable of remedying destitution are oftentimes least affected to do so, not realizing their privileged position to help mankind. Yet promise for this disease's vaccination demands appreciation from even the most tenuously connected individuals; that we have been able to rise against nature's difficulties time and again is truly astounding, a testament to the ingenuity and determination characteristic of the human race. Efforts to end the proliferation of Ebola exemplify this struggle, in which we are all united as human beings, atop much hardship, curiosity, and daring to assume autonomy on planet earth. Regardless of ideology, echelon, and race, all are indebted to this world community of endeavor, with ample reason for thanks. Still, one observes seething racial hatreds, religious persecution, and countless other instances of animosity festering worldwide.

Despite the effort to find a cure or treat those who were sick, over 11,000 people died because of the virus. Some of the doctors even came back into the U.S. after contracting Ebola from patients, which caused a lot of worry as to how easily this would effect people in the U.S. and if it would cause an outbreak. Last Friday, however, vaccine for Ebola was found, and it shows results in about 10 days. This same vaccine was successful in monkeys a few years ago, but was never used because there was no need to worry about the Ebola virus at the time. The fear of finding a vaccine after thousands of people have already died from a disease haunts doctors. They're not sure which major disease will strike next, and testing vaccines takes a lot of time and costs millions of dollars. Therefore, a global vaccine-development fund has been proposed. This fund will raise money to fund the creation and testing of up to five different vaccines. This article interested me because the effect of the Ebola virus was devastating and we need to be prepared for another outbreak no matter where or what it could be. This fund will hopefully help doctors find vaccines for sudden outbreaks in a quicker amount of time with less trouble and money issues.",,,,,,,
" New illnesses call for new vaccines to be made. Vaccinations are meant to prevent or stop the progression of an illness but for many unknown illnesses of the world vaccines must be created, these creations can take months up to years to perfect. Sometimes vaccines are created and not used. Carl Zimmer‚Äôs ‚Äú For Vaccines Needed in an Epidemic, Timing is Everything‚Äù  speaks on how vaccines are created but only pushed to be looked into in a panic after an epidemic. He and other scientist argue that vaccinations that are created even before its illness becomes an epidemic should be funded/ supported so that in its time of need more lives can be saved. Included in the article is the topic of an Ebola vaccine that was created before its epidemic but only looked into after its epidemic ‚ÄúDr. Berkley and other vaccine experts note a grim irony. Scientist showed this vaccine was effective in monkeys a decade ago. Therefore, the vaccine lingered in scientific limbo.‚Äù If a vaccine is found before it‚Äôs time why not use it, over the past couple of years many different illnesses have made an  appearance; Pertussis, swine flu, bird flu, ebola, aids, etc.., there's no way to tell when the vaccine will come in handy but at least there will already be a vaccine there to prevent the spread.",,,,,,,
"     Ebola was something of a novelty just a few months ago and now it is rarely noted. When the first headline was made about the new and terrifying disease, it was all that was talked about. It was slapped across every newspaper and documented on every news station. People were making plans for what would happen if it spread and scientists were working day and night to find a cure. The world stopped for a moment and was then sent into a state of panic. Now a little over a year later, it is virtually gone and rarely worried about and probably safely locked in the vaults of Fort Ditrick. It is amazing how people can change from one topic to another. The fact that a disease that once threatened the streets at home, has now been terminated is phenomenal. What I find interesting is that there is such little publicity for the resolution of Ebola. If it was not resolved earlier, when did we stop noticing it? When did we deem ourselves immune to what was happening? Diseases do not just go away, so why did the publicity and the distress stop so abruptly? I believe with the rapid advancements in technology and medicine, people feel more protected and therefore there is less panic. We now have diagnostic tests for Ebola and promising vaccines, so now there is no novelty because it can now be treated. Although not entirely true, it is astonishing how easily people can be reassured, but even more so just how easily people can be sent into a panic. ",,,,,,,

I feel as if  society has become dependent and reliant on having an immediate fix to their problems that will inevitably occur. This lack of sense of danger is a downfall when preventing future problems. This article interested me, because it sparked a debate in which should we only focus on preventing the problem that is in front of us or do we continue to advance to preemptively  stop future problems or diseases. The sad truth that I found is that our human nature will question wether or not life or lives is worth the amount of money spent to save it. The creation of a vaccine mirrors our accomplishment of doing well in that moment for brief amount of time and our unconscious decision making. This situation at least made me question wether I spend time dealing with problems that have already happened or making sure I prevent problems from happening in the first place. ",,,,,,,

It was titled 'Not Vaccinating Children is the Greater Risk'. I decided to stop and read it because many times a have failed to get a vaccine for the flu each year and I was interested to see what the risks were. The article states that not getting vaccines can puts your child in harms way that's why some states have banned kids not vaccinated to enter a public school system. It also read that vaccines might not always work but when they do it puts you at a significantly small risk of getting infected. It spoke on individual diseases and what they can do to you and almost all can lead to death. Now that I am equipped with this new information I'll be sure to pass it on.",,,,,,,

"Title X is as important to the health and welfare of this country as mandatory vaccinations.  It should not be cut.  It's funding should be exponentially expanded.  As a nurse working in Labor and Delivery and later in surgery, I repeatedly saw the results of ignoring these issues in the hopes that they would go away.  As Bristol Palin can attest, abstinence, like Natural Family Planning results in the production of parents.  Untreated STD's result in pelvic inflammatory disease, with scarring and endometriosis.  Untreated HPV results in cervical and anal cancer and as Michael Douglas can tell you, oral cancer.  This isn't about the politics of the pelvis.  This is about real health and well being issues.  The ounce of prevention is a whole lot cheaper than the pound of cure.  ",,,,,,,

"Back then, the theory of vaccines was that giving shots to pregnant women would harm their babies.

Brody interested me the most because it was amazing to find out that there are so many benefits regarding vaccines. If only people took the time to read highly recommended articles, there might not have been as many outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Brody writes, ‚ÄúDr. Sawyer blamed a lack of scientific literacy for recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases‚Ä¶‚Äù Dr. Sawyer reports that when people don‚Äôt read, they miss out on all of the knowledge that could be a lifesaver. I mean, literally, newly learned knowledge can be a lifesaver when it comes to saving someone‚Äôs life. Giving vaccines to pregnant women can not only save the mother, but also the child. For example, women should consider being immunized against hepatitis B. It is an infection, that without the vaccine, could be passed onto babies. After babies catch hepatitis B, it stays with them and can cause liver damage once they reach the adult stage. Wow! Who knew vaccines given to pregnant women could save babies‚Äô lives.",,,,,,,

But they did what every parent does when raising kids in a dangerous world: they took a risk to forestall an even bigger risk.<br/><br/>Here's another thing that anti-vaxxers don't get. Just because you choose not to vaccinate, that is NO guarantee that these diseases won't eventually find and overwhelm your child. And when your deathly ill child ends up in the ER, are you going to refuse the modern medicine needed to save your child because of what might be ""in"" those treatments? No. You're going to call in the medical cavalry. <br/><br/>How hypocritical!<br/><br/>If vaccines were the instruments of death that anti-vaxxers claim they are, every vaccinated person would be seriously debilitated. But they aren't. <br/><br/>They aren't the ones with the problem.",,,,,,,

Rather than relying on a dot-com website that could have out-of-date or downright erroneous information on it, it would be far better to have a consultation with a qualified health care professional that could help pregnant women make an informed decision on whether or not to get the TDap.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons why it is so important to talk about these issues with qualified medical professionals rather than ""doing your own research"" is that the medical community, by virtue of its profession, usually has the most up-to-date information and statistics available regarding clinical trials and research data on any given drug. <br/><br/>Eventually this information will flow outward via the internet. But when it concerns our health, why not deal with the people that ACTUALLY know rather than the ones that just THINK they know? Make an appointment with a medical professional who can explain the TDap vaccine, its purpose, what the current research is surrounding it, and whether it makes sense to have it in a particular case. <br/><br/>The is what differentiates real experts from the people that just troll the internet and make unsubstantiated claims about things they really know nothing about.<br/><br/>So no, Kristin, the author didn't ""fail.""

Safety is an abstract concept that cannot be measured. What is measured is the presence of perceived, statistically significant HARM, and NO, anecdotal evidence to the tune of ""my nephew was vaccinated and now he's autistic"" does not count. In the absence of measurable, statistically significant harm, a product, drug, or food can be added to the marketplace. It doesn't mean it's safe because nothing, not even water and air, is truly safe. It just means that the probability is very high that you will not be harmed.",,,,,,,
"The antibodies from breastfeeding often get to the baby too late. That is, if the mother and baby are exposed to the flu at the same time, they will likely both develop it.

"Hahahah what do they do that we do not? Firstly, they allow abortions without all the messy red tape we impose on women, so people who aren't ready financially/emotionally/etc are able to plan their families properly. Women aren't forced to bear children they cannot afford, and can therefore devote enough time and resources to raising them. Secondly and thirdly, they have very low childhood poverty rates and childhood violence rates because they have a strong social support network and almost no guns. Those facts account for much more than which vaccines are given, but you ignore those differences in the cultures and focus instead on something that serves your own particular bias. Interesting.

"I've lived in similar countries. And to date, there are no vaccines to prevent what people died from most commonly in these areas [including parts of Africa and Asia]. Clean water, sanitation infrastructure and increased nutrition would have done far more, along with a cheap mosquito net to help prevent malaria [yet somehow with all the billions spend in the development industry each year, they still don't have an adequate means for distrubuting such things to EVERYONE in these areas]. No, they'd rather experiment on those poor people with unsafe trial vaccines that have been funded with millions of aid industry dollars, paid out to the likes of Bill Gates and others. And for yourself: The FLU shot? Really? That's your go to for vaccine advocacy? The FLU shot is known to be not particularly effective and to have side effects [aka known possibility of harm]. People in developing countries might die of flu due to dehydration or previous primary or secondary issues or infections. The flu is really not some sweeping pandemic that we can vaccinate ourselves out of. But feel free to keep making that choice for YOUR family. FYI: Many people have never received a flu shot and have gotten the flu once, if at all. There are other healthcare options in the world. Western modern, tech driven, industry backed medicine is not the holy grail for everyone. It is a choice-yes, people will use emergency care as they choose.",,,,,,,
"LOL. Have you seen the entire list of vaccine 'ingredients'. Tell us how any of these are 'safe' for pregnant women? Remember how many decades doctors, advertising and government agencies told us that 'smoking was fine, even healthy' in pregnant women? And did not cause low birth weight or other issues? Ditto alcohol. And just a few years ago, it was specifically not recommended to vaccination during pregnancy. I find it so strange that within 5 years' time, people have forgotten this entirely. Let's not forget that time the 'industry' convinced women that breastfeeding was not healthy or 'as healthy' as formula. We're still recovering as a society from that one---with many hospitals still not advocating or knowing how to support breastfeeding. I suppose somehow, magically, THIS time is different. THIS time the government backed by industry interests, is not lying to us, not marketing dangerous truths as though they are helpful practices. Sure. Wow. It's depressing how the self proclaimed 'pro science, intellectual elite' live in such denial---Do you not see that you essentially have a 'right or wrong' framework? You do not allow any questioning of your beliefs [and they are beliefs, not facts]. There is no nuance to this discussion, yet you accuse anyone questioning safety or big pharma as a 'crazy extremist'. The profits received by the vaccine industry, and the fact that vaccines require LESS testing time precisely because 'it's a public health measure', are not enough?",,,,,,,
"Modestly profitable? Wow. Someone hasn't done their homework. Google is your friend. It's astounding that someone in this day and age could make that statement. Vaccines are part of the pharmaceutical industry and both make billions. Global vaccine market is expected to hit 50 billion [up from 25] by 2025. How are people not learning this information? Yet, these same people are comfortable posting on articles as though their statements are absolutely fact. Please research people. Honestly, if you still feel vaccines are wonderful, along with pharmaceuticals as a whole, great. But do not say that approvals of new drugs do not involve wall street traders more than scientists. The former is in fact present in larger numbers than the latter, at said hearings. Calls are made, stocks go up and down. Former head of CDC recently dumped a bunch of her Merck stocks, totally millions. 'Moderately profitable' should never be used in the same sentence as the pharmaceutical or medical industrial complex.",,,,,,,
"None of those other products are being forcibly marketed and promoted or mandated in exchange for any other service or civil right. And all of the products you mentioned have manufacturers that can be sued for liability or harm, rather than some secret, decades old, government run court. Yes, ""someone a person knows whose child regressed or was harmed by vaccines"" 'including autism', DOES count. Your semantics and word play are self serving, designed to support your cognitive dissonance on this issue. Medical freedom is a human right. The fact that 'science' [in this case, proven corporate driven, industry backed science marketing, masquerading as fact and altruism/public good] shows 'statistically' little chance of 'harm' [again,t his is your interpretation of the data], does not prove that harm is not possible. Sure, statistics are a convenient way to maintain sociopathic tendency on behalf of the medical industrial complex. That cartel is happy to let us sit around throwing vitriolic insults at one another, while they laugh all the way to the bank and then some. YOU don't get to decide what 'statistically significant' means for MY medical and healthcare choices, however. 'Safe' is simply a term used and the fact that it is subjective is shown in your statements. Safe to me means I feel comfortable taking inherent risk in using any consumer product. Simply b/c you feel that these statistics and inability to prove 'safe' [according to your definition] doesn't count.",,,,,,,
"Not one vaccine, NOT ONE is approved by the manufacturer to be administered while pregnant. READ THE VACCINE INSERTS!! This is a most dangerous article.

They tell you to avoid smoking, caffeine and cold water fish, but it's ok to inject a flu vaccine? Ridiculous.",,,,,,,
"Okay, when all else fails, attack the messenger. And at that, attack a single messenger. smh. We all know government agencies and universities are never biased and never bought by corporate lobbying groups. Unless of course, one is talking about the government's own vaccine lobbying group itself [NACCHO], who aspires to remove right to medical choice and enforce consumer purchase of vaccines, influencing state and national politicians in doing so. I honestly could spend all day replying to comments on this article. And I feel similarly to what many have said; it is dismaying how many are irrational about discussing or even questioning that perhaps vaccines are not safe or effective. I was under the impression that science continually evolves and that we are not at the 'peak' of modern medicine-we are only in the present day experiment-one that will likely look foolish to those in the future who study 'us'. Regardless, medical care is a choice. Health Freedom is a fundamental right. Prochoice. My body. My choice. Remember that rhetoric? You don't get to decide a parent's medical choices for their child, either. That this is even in discussion in the USA in 2015 is utterly creepy.",,,,,,,
"What preventable infections? Are there vaccines for all of these? You do realize statistically that most of the diseases for which we have vaccines today are contracted by newly or currently vaccinated, right? Your comment is vague enough to fit the standard OP of manipulation and circular logic that supports continued one sided discussion of this issue in mainstream media. Also, what other issues were these stillborn and liveborn babies dealing with at time of birth or in utero? What were their conditions-socioeconomic, prexisting, etc? You do realize that every condition or infection does not have a corresponding vaccine, right? Of course, with nearly 300 vaccines in the development pipeline, I'm sure they're working on it. Feel free to play russian roulette with YOUR child in experimenting with all of these vaccines. That is the point: We are all free to take medical risks and make such decisions on behalf of our own children. The state does not have that right. Nor does group think or mob justice, PC paradigm of the day. By their own admission, vaccines do not undergo the same rigorous or lengthy testing, b/c the 'are a public health measure' and therefore we simply 'must get them to the market' for people to use! LOL. It IS a market, first of all. We are consumers, purchasing vaccines. They are not free. Secondly, that statement confirms that they are not rigorously tested. So that part of the vaccine argument is null and void. ",,,,,,,

One, it's amazing that you have that much free time. Two, I was just wondering... Maybe it's none of my business, but just how much does a vaccine manufacturer pay a guy like you to troll these types of articles and try to invalidate anything anyone says? I mean, are you paid per reply? Or is it a flat-rate type of gig? Do they supply you with a copy &amp; paste document to use excepts from in your replies? Must be good work... There must be an awful lot of money at stake to hire guns all over the country just to reply to posts all day. I wonder why that would be necessary? I wonder why it would be worth it for any company to go to such an extreme and expense, to protect their product. Blogging about it is one thing. Sending out a press release is another. But paying people to reply to every single thing written about something on the web, just seems paranoid and hysterical to me... Wow... Just wow...",,,,,,,

"Mercury comes in different forms. Some vaccines contain mercury in compound form (Thimerosal). It must be stressed that this IS NOT a straight metal form of mercury. The article in the attached link shows that there are two forms of compounds, neither of which result in accumulation due to their short life.<br/><br/>Mercury poisoning is usually associated with regular long-term exposure, not something like a vaccine. The most dangerous forms of mercury are when mercury is part of an organic compound, such as when it  accumulates in the body of a fish which we then consume. That's when we take in the most dangerous organic form of the mercury, one which can then also accumulate in our body.",,,,,,,
"No medical intervention can be guaranteed to be 100% safe, but vaccines are not harmful for the vast majority of people who take them, pregnant women included. We know this because millions of pregnant women have been vaccinated with no ill effect. The tiny risk of the vaccine far outweighs the very real risk that you and your children will come down with a serious virus. The chances are much higher that you will find yourself or your newborn in the ICU on a ventilator than with having an adverse reaction to this vaccine.<br/><br/>A vaccine purposely triggers only a tiny portion of the gene-chain of a disease, thus activating the immune system only at a low level, while catching a disease triggers the entire gene-chain and therefore is much more stressful to the immune system. What you should be fearing are diseases, disfigurement, disability and death from illness, not vaccines.",,,,,,,

The treatment began with a vomit, followed by a strong cathartic. The prescribed diet was bread, milk, pudding, and rice. Adams describes the inoculation procedure itself:Dr. Perkins demanded my left arm. They took their Launcetts and with their Points divided the skin about a Quarter of an inch and just suffering the blood to appear, buried a thread (infected) about a Quarter of an inch long in the Channell. A little lint was then laid over the scratch and a Piece of Ragg pressed on, and then a Bandage bound over all. Adams and 9 other patients were confined to the hospital for 3 weeks.

"Correct, not everyone who receives a vaccine is equally immunized. But the fact is, no vaccine has ever controlled or prevented any disease throughout history. It's sounds like medical blasphemy. But, if you want to do some research, then go back and look at the history of vaccines. Every epidemic that has ever existed was handled YEARS before the vaccine was developed - this is the thing everyone misses. This is the ONE point of research that flies over everyone's head. People would rather look at the first page of a Google search than actually do any real research. Let's look at an example. Way back in the middle ages, Europe suffered from the Black Plague. It nearly wiped out 2/3rds of the population. It was bad. We've never had an epidemic even come close to those numbers since then. What handled it? A vaccine? No - they didn't exist yet. However, it was in fact handled, for good. So what did it? Better sanitation, cleaner domiciles and basically just not eating anything the rats had gotten into. Too obvious, right? Well, believe it or not, that was the cure. Why do 3rd world countries have such rampant disease? It's not because they lack a track record of vaccines. They live in squalor... they have terrible sanitation, if any at all... filthy living conditions and hands - which they also eat with... and drinking &amp; bathing water mixed with raw sewage... I assure you, if we in the USA lived like they do, no vaccine in the world would protect us. And THAT is the point.",,,,,,,

But even if they didn't, the amount of mercury in a vaccine is negligible and less than in a can of tuna, which is NOT forbidden for pregnant women if consumed just once or twice weekly. And even if it weren't, there is no evidence it causes autism or whatever harm you fear.<br/><br/>There are a lot of studies by a lot of reputable groups in this<br/>country and others that show no link between thimerosal and autism.<br/>The two pieces of evidence that I think are clearest are 1)  Two<br/>Canadian provinces never allowed these use of thimerosal containing<br/> vaccines to be used in children -  these provinces have the same rates<br/>of autism as the rest of Canada.  Socialized medicine keeps good<br/>records.  2)  In the United States, the use of thimerosal containing<br/>vaccines has been eliminated or greatly reduced in children over the<br/> last few years.

"Pregnant women get thimerisol-free vaccines. A study of influenza vaccination examining over 2,000 pregnant women demonstrated no adverse fetal effects associated with influenza vaccine. Case reports and limited studies indicate that pregnancy can increase the risk for serious medical complications of influenza. One study found that out of every 10,000 women in their third trimester of pregnancy during an average flu season, 25 will be hospitalized for flu related complications.Additionally, influenza-associated excess deaths among pregnant women have been documented during influenza pandemics. Because pregnant women are at increased risk for influenza-related complications and because a substantial safety margin has been incorporated into the health guidance values for organic mercury exposure, the benefits of influenza vaccine with reduced or standard thimerosal content outweighs the theoretical risk, if any, of thimerosal.<br/><br/>The risk of influenza in pregnancy is REAL. In 2009, a particularly bad year for flu, 100 pregnant women needed intensive care unit treatment, with 28<br/> fatalities.  Furthermore, the amount of mercury is fairly trivial.  While the kindof mercury is somewhat different, the amount of mercury in a<br/>thimerosal containing shot is somewhat less than in a small can of<br/>tunafish, but pregnant women are NOT told to avoid tuna fish, only to limit the amount they consume.<br/><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/health/10primer.html"" title=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/health/10primer.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/health/10primer.html</a>",,,,,,,

"The rationale for giving Tdap to pregnant women is to stimulate the immune response in the mother and transmit the protective antibodies against pertussis to the fetus/newborn infant This was in response to the increased prevalence of pertussis, ""whooping cough"", infections in the communities from the lack of herd immunity because of anti-Vaxxers. Infants aren't vaccinated until age 1 year, so they are succeptible to the infection.<br/>If the general population was adequately immunized, 95% or more, then, there would be no need to immunize pregnant women with Tdap. So the personal decisions of a small fraction of the population, anti-Vaxxers, has required the exposure of all pregnant women in the US to the Tdap vaccine. ",,,,,,,

My child's pediatrician only knew how to ""reassure.""  She was great at that.  Now she looks like an idiot...to her peers as well.  Another pediatrician stated that even when he knows something is wrong, he does not tell the parent because they may get all hyper and think it is the vaccines.

What is the chemical agent universally present in all vaccines, and what is the mechanism by which it ""causes"" autism to develop? And, why do the vast majority of children who get vaccinated NOT get autism? <br/><br/>None of the anti-vaccination crowd can answer this, because the anti-vaccination movement is based on a complete lack of scientific knowledge. There is a scientific explanation for how vaccines work to prevent disease - it isn't magic or guesswork, it's knowledge of biology. If there were a scientific explanation for how vaccines cause autism, that viewpoint would be more credible.

"There has been a vaccine in the pipeline of testing for years for this disease, and one wonders if a bit of our military budget might be sidetracked to fast-track this research as our overheated world is likely to generate more, rather than less, Legionella bacteria in dense urban settings worldwide.  <br/><br/>As Legionella is cysteine and iron dependent for it reproductive environment, treatment of water cooling towers with ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (EDTA) chelates the metals in water and therefore disrupts the environment for this bacteria to reproduce.  Metals including iron dissolve readily in water.  Chelates bind with them and take them out.  This increases the longevity of systems which suffer less scaling and inefficiency due to the presence of metals.  Water heaters, for example, are notorious for failing because iron accumulates and falls to the bottom of the glass liner in smaller tanks where it superheats and causes the lining to crack and fail.  <br/><br/>One suspects that buildings with crimped budgets, cut back on the water treatment cycle for their cooling towers.

"Dear Walter,<br/>In fairness, Ebola is a very different critter, a virus for which we have no cure and (as yet) no vaccine, and its fatality rate is something like 80% without good treatment, dropping to maybe 30% with full modern hospitalization.  Legionnaires isn't contagious, is easily treated once diagnosed, and even if there's no treatment at all it'd kill only about 25%.  Unfortunately Legionnaires outbreaks are going to happen repeatedly for the foreseeable future, because it's a naturally occurring bacteria and it's everywhere.  The U.S. gets about 8 to 18,000 diagnosed cases per year, and more that don't get diagnosed.<br/><br/>However, we do have contagious and highly lethal diseases here that should worry us as much as Ebola, namely AIDS and antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis.

It's not a black and white issue and today hopefully more people are aware of the need for education, vaccinations, and job creation in Zimbabwe. Eco-tourism can bring more tourists and open even more eyes to the beauty of Africa rather than a few wealthy trophy hunters can. And yes, we still have many wrongs to right in the United States but these are battles we can wage alongside others like this one. I hope with your advanced education you can return and help lead your country out of hunger and political violence. Many of us do care.",,,,,,,
"In fact, malaria is in decline in Africa due to various American-sponsored interventions, including distribution of mosquito nets (which get appropriated for fishing nets!), extremely promising work on a vaccine, on certain genetically altered mosquitoes, etc.  Americans have demonstrated a pretty good history of ""caring about African people.""

"It is possible to care about more than one thing at once.  Compassion teaches compassion.  How do you know what Mr. Kimmel would or wouldn't do if he was asked about children dying of malaria?   Here's some perspective: the U.S. committed to spend one BILLION dollars fighting Ebola in West Africa, and that was just the government. Thousands of Americans volunteered to go work with Ebola patients despite the threat to their own health, and the U.S. sent 3900 troops to build hospitals and treatment centers.  By 2013 Starbucks corporation had sent over $13 million dollars to Africa to fight AIDS, all raised through customers exercising COMPASSION and buying  ""Red"" products instead of other products.  That is just one company.  As of 2012, the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation had spent $1.3 billion dollars fighting malaria, and another $5.3 billion fighting tuberculosis and AIDS.  Additionally, the measles cases in Africa dropped by 90% due to their vaccination program.  So, when you think we are glib about these things you are ignoring the facts to support your own dogmatic approach.  You see, as I said, compassion teaches compassion.",,,,,,,

"A New York Times article, published earlier this month, that peaked my interest is titled ‚ÄúEvery Virus a Person Has Had Can Be Seen in a Drop of Blood, researchers find‚Äù by Denise Grady.  This article relates how scientists developed a test to see what infections people had by the antibodies they developed.  Researchers are talking about how this discovery will pave the way towards learning about, and potentially curing, infectious diseases.  For example, they could conduct a study to learn what viruses infect people at what ages and determine the best timing for vaccines.  Doctors could understand why chemotherapy works better for some cancer patients than others.  I resonate with this information; from the time I was young, I wondered, ‚ÄúIf they haveantibiodics, , why don‚Äôt they have medications for common viruses?‚Äù  Some of the facts were unexpected.  For example, although different people recover at varying rates, most of our immune systems are nearly identical.

"Not Vaccinating Children Is the Greater Risk<br/>By: Jane E. Brody<br/>I recently heard that parents have stopped getting their children vaccinated so I thought I would read this article to understand why. The article says that some parents are misinformed and choose to not get their child the shot despite the doctor saying it is good for them. It also says ""some parents balk at the seemingly large number of vaccines administered to young children, who can get as many as 23 shots by age 2."" The children need that many because that is when the risk is the highest. One other thing that seemed interesting was that some people belive in herd immunization, this is when the people around you are safe so you are to even though you were the only one to not get vaccinated. They are taking action though California now doesn't allow children to go to school without the immunization.",,,,,,,
"‚ÄúA Milestone in Africa: No Polio Cases in a Year‚Äù<br/>Disease is an awful but inevitable part of our world that has the power to destroy populations in the blink of an eye. Some locations are worse off than others and worry about it more because of their higher risk of disease due to lack of money, nutrition, and doctors.  However, Africa reached a milestone yesterday, August 11, 2015, as it has been one year without any diagnosed Polio cases.  Polio is a disease that attacks muscles and currently, the paralyzing disease is only present in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The doctors in Africa worked extremely hard to achieve their goal by hiring ‚Äúmobilizers to track down people in unvaccinated areas‚Äù and vaccinating them.  Given the mass size of Africa, I have an unlimited amount of admiration for the brave people who traveled to potentially dangerous areas.  I feel lucky to live somewhere where I do not need to worry about many deadly illnesses, and I am relieved that the number of places with risky diseases is declining rapidly. Africa needs to go two more years with no reported cases to be considered ‚ÄúPolio-free‚Äù as the USA is, but I believe that since they‚Äôve accomplished the original goal, maintaining it will be much easier than reaching it was.  As far as we know, disease and sickness will always be a part of life, but with advanced technology and smart, dedicated researchers and doctors, cures are becoming much more common, and deadly illnesses are becoming much less common.",,,,,,,

"A Mile Stone in Africa: No Polio Cases in a Year<br/>This article caught my attention because I know Africa is a disease hot spot in the world.  Most of the population is poor and can't afford medicine, so they get sick easily and disease spreads especially in the villages.  When I saw that Africa has been polio-free for a year it shocked me.  It all started when the governor of Kano stopped the vaccinations and it spread across Africa and all the way into Yemen because of the high Muslim populations in the Northern countries.  Rumors spread that Muslim girls were being sterilized and there were pork products in the vaccines.  Donors have been putting billions into this campaign to try and get people to accept it, which has succeeded.  I'm very happy that Polio so far is out of Africa.  Africa has struggled immensely for years, it doesn't need another disease to struggle with. ",,,,,,,
"A Milestone in Africa: No Polio Cases in a Year<br/>Africa has managed to have no reported cases of polio in one year. This is a great achievement for a continent which has 54 countries and occupied by nomads, resistant leaders and muslims. There were a few years in which the Boko Haram group caused disruption in the distribution of polio vaccination and then rumours spread saying the vaccination was not halal and contained the AIDS virus. After a bit of work, WHO managed to convince the Muslim leaders that the vaccinations were safe and halal. These were only some of the setbacks in removing polio from Africa (particularly Nigeria). Though this is a great milestone Africa must wait 2 more years for WHO to announce it free of polio. There is also still more to be done to eradicate polio entirely from the world, recently there have been reports of cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan but scientists say they have the end in sight.",,,,,,,
"In 2014 scientist launched an experimental vaccine against Ebola, they recently announced that the vaccine was a success. Although the vaccine worked, some doctors say that it could have launched earlier. ‚ÄúWe should have had an Ebola vaccine at least two or three years ago,‚Äù said Dr. Peter J. Hotez. This is an interesting topic because if some doctors are right, the vaccine could have saved thousands of people that Ebola killed two years ago. After the West African epidemic, scientists accelerated the trials of the vaccine.<br/>The reason scientists delayed the research of the vaccine is due to the money that it cost. This shows that researchers need more money, and it teaches how money influences the world. If there would have been money to pay for the vaccine, all the people that died due to Ebola might have been saved. Doctors fear that other viruses might spread and the same thing might happen. People are now  suggesting to donate 2 billion dollars for the research of different viruses. This is why this is a troubling  topic, because it could happen again and without the vaccines people will be unprepared.  ",,,,,,,
"A Milestone in Africa: No Polio Cases in a Year<br/>By: Donald G. McNeil Jr.<br/><br  The decrease of polio cases in Africa will greatly improve the way of life and general welfare of the continent. Africa‚Äôs population has been affected by numerous infectious diseases, one of them being polio. Polio has no specific cure, thus it is very fortunate that the polio cases in Africa have been decreasing to the point where they have been none in a whole year. Even though the continent is not considered to be polio-free for another two years, it is amazing that this disease is finally becoming less and less prominent. This is a major milestone for the general health of the population of Africa and a great success in medicine. People were able to develop aggressive ways to tackle the spread of polio by vaccinating the public and constantly monitoring the spread of the disease. The possible elimination of polio also helps Africa socially. Much of the public resented the western intervention and felt that they should not be interfering in the lives of Africans even though they were helping to rid the disease of the public. The decrease of polio cases also means more stability within the public. It marks the end of many violent events and harsh feelings towards these health organizations and vaccinators. The absence of polio cases in Nigeria is a giant step in medicine and hopefully soon, cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan will lessen and the polio disease will be eliminated from the entire world.",,,,,,,

Really?  Where are the fools among the Democrats?  Where are the Michele Bachmanns, who claimed that the HPV vaccine caused mental retardation? Where are the birthers, who deny that our current president is even an American citizen?<br/><br/>There may be many weak politicians on the Democratic side, but there is just no comparison. And what this author declines to recognize is that Jon Stewart did in fact go after Democratic politicans who erred.  Best example is Anthony Weiner, who was skewered by Stewart.

They fight tooth and nail against diplomatic victories (the Iran deal), they talk openly about how the POTUS is a secret Kenyan Muslim who ""hates America"", they're pro-austerity even after the European experiment in extreme austerity failed, and some serious candidates for president even spoke out against the existence of a Supreme Court.<br/><br/>Jon Stewart was the only public person to point this out and let us laugh about it, when all we (Non-Crazy Republicans, lefties) want to do is cry.",,,,,,,

"I searched this article in vain for the author's own solution to the immigration problem, but there's nothing substantive to this piece, just the same partisan attacks on Republicans.  So, I'm just curious: what is it exactly that progressives want on immigration? Open borders?  A system that permits unrestricted access to those who can walk through the southern border, but forces the rest of the world to comply with a legal process (health checks, criminal checks, etc.)? Really?  Talk about racism:  progressives want those from African countries to gain entry only after complying with visa procedures, and getting the proper vaccinations; but if you're from Central America you can just come in and suddenly vaccinations don't really matter anyway.  I suppose the author would be okay with Africans flying to Honduras and then walking up through our border.  But what about possible terrorism? What about gangs?  Well, you must be a racist or xenophobe if you bring that up, and don't you know that La Raza has all the ""studies"" showing that hispanic immigrants actually pose less of a threat of crime than their poor, dumb, white-trash counterparts.  No need to engage in critical thinking on the issue, so long as La Raza can point to a ""study.""<br/><br/>The only real answer is to seal the border first, and then deal humanely with those already here, which is the Republican position.

"It's hard to even conceive of this sort of propaganda as evidenced-based science. It's the same sort of stuff that the tobacco companies had been using since the 1940s in order to divert attention away from the harm caused by carcinogens inherent in tobacco itself. This sort of nonsense may be protected speech under the First Amendment, but it is utterly incompatible with someone calling himself a scientist. Any scientist or physician lending his name and his professional credentials in support of this publicity campaign deserves to have his credentials reviewed. If these researchers are academics, the principle of academic freedom generally allows unpopular views to be held which when vetted in the public square, the truth will out.<br/><br/>But holding erroneous ideas is not the same as promoting harmful food products. People's lives are at stake, and the public interest requires that responsible public authorities step in. This is really no different from requiring that children be vaccinated against communicable diseases. These are not matters of opinion on which reasonable people can differ as a matter of personal choice. The fact that sugary soft drinks, Coca-Cola in particular, are deeply embedded in our national culture does not give them a pass from holding them accountable for the long-term physical injury that these drinks inflict, starting with small children. Simply put, parents and caregivers need help in saying no, now that the long-term consequences are well-known.",,,,,,,

Moreover, don't you think that Al Gore and his climate change cronies pay for ""science"" to declare man-made global warming as a scientific fact?

I see so many duped by this propaganda, ready to jump on anyone who questions the vaccine program as 'anti-science', without realizing that, for just one example, the CDC whistleblower Dr. Thompson is on record saying that they took documents linking the MMR to autism and threw it into a 'big garbage can.' Yes, that happened. The lie that vaccines saved us all from infectious disease and that they are 'safe and effective' is everywhere, and the majority of people have bought it.",,,,,,,
"Vaccination does not provide absolute immunity in all cases. But that's not the point. <br/><br/>After the polio vaccines were introduced, nation by nation, polio rates dropped to near zero, also nation by nation. This amounts to as good as we can get proof that the vaccination campaigns were the cause of the reduction in polio. <br/><br/>For those of us who were young in the days of massive polio epidemics, the advent of vaccination was a godsend. Just like that, our chance of being lamed or killed by polio dropped from something on the order of 1 percent, to effectively zero. <br/><br/>Measles is a serious disease.

"These carefully controlled studies are frequently tainted by their source of money. Treatments or advise in one generation is malpractice in another. Women had to fight to not have their breasts lopped off in a radical mastectomy. There must have been some studies to make that the treatment of choice and another study to prove it is not. <br/><br/>Patients feel better when their doctor gives them reassurance that they are healthy or at least not very sick. This is what drives the market for the annual physical. They are almost worthless in finding disease but great for making people believe they are healthy after the  expense of unnecessary tests and time wasted. Belief that an annually physical is a sign of health makes people very smug about getting one every year in spite of the statistical evident. <br/><br/>Yes, there are people who may have had a dread disease discovered but they are a very very small minority. People's lives are improved by some procedures but there is no gold standard. What are the facts at one time are out of date twenty years later.<br/>I am not saying there isn't value in western medicine but it is not as evidence based as you think. Frequently doctors invoke what they learned in their medical school as the best treatment. Science has improved the lives of people. As one commenter said, vaccines are of great value, contrary to what anti-vaxers think. But the placebo effect cannot be ignored in western medicine. There are studies for that too.",,,,,,,

"I'm a biologist, and have had numerous discussions with anti-vaccine/anti-science types. they face two primary problems: an incapacitating fear that comes from ignorance, and a lack of will to earn the actual facts about vaccines. <br/><br/>Many of them believe the lies pushed on them, including the risible idea that industry, the government, and researchers are in a giant conspiracy to profit by injecting toxins like ""aluminum"" and ""buffers"" into people. They won't listen when you tell them that there's more aluminum in breast milk (strangely, they don't seem to worry about wrapping their food in aluminum foil). And never mind that the buffers used for vaccines are...salt water...as in...table salt. Fear is a very powerful motivator of irrational thinking. <br/><br/>The only solution is to pass laws forcing people to act in their children's best interests. The anti-vaxxers will cry,  protest, and suffer sleepless nights borne of irrational fears, but their children won't be maimed or killed by preventable diseases, and their grandchildren won't suffer congenital rubella syndrome.

"Herd immunity is a myth.

Polio today includes acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, a range of enterovirus infections and more.  In the 1950s and 1960s all of those diseases were classified as polio - without testing for the polio virus. Medical treatments no longer require 'iron lungs' so the really scary aspect that compelled people to line their children up for vaccines has changed. People are researching on their own and finding that vaccines cause disease, damage and death and the risks are high.<br/><br/>The written history of smallpox vaccine (court records and newspaper accounts of the time) demonstrate that the vaccine caused more disease and death than it prevented.

The paper he wrote was withdrawn by the publisher. Thompson is on record (after this all happened) saying that vaccination is a good thing. ",,,,,,,
"Alvin, you do realize that not one person gets vaccinated because they want to protect society??  They do it because they think it will protect them from the disease they are getting vaccinated from.<br/><br/>Here is a link to a study that shows the potential link to infant mortality and number of vaccination given in infancy:  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/?tool=pubmed"" title=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/?tool=pubmed"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/?tool=pubmed</a><br/><br/>I know you will brush this off however don't you find it a little bit disturbing that our country which is the most medically advanced nation (according to all the pro-vaxxers) has one of the lowest infant mortality rates among the civilized world?  You would think if vaccinations were so safe and effective it would be reversed that the US would be #1` in infant mortality since we have weeded out these horrible diseases third world kids get and we don't have war lords mass murdering people on the streets.<br/><br/>Again, take a look at the real statistics of measles from when it was at its peak infection rates in this country and you will see less than 1% of children infected ended up dying of severely ill.  Once the vaccination was introduced the disease was already on a drastic decline, so again while you can say the vaccination helped if you actually look at the statistics which I guess one could call pseudoscience they tell a different story.",,,,,,,
"As I was reading through the headlines and brief descriptions of various articles throughout this website, this particular headline peaked my interest. The reason being is I have always assumed that everybody got their vaccinations except in nations that would not always have access to them such as many third world countries. So, as I continued reading I was shocked to know that many people throughout the United States have decided against vaccinations due to their own personal belief. Although some people believe that vaccinations could lead to harmful side effects, the scientific facts show the success rate of many diseases that were treated with a vaccination and I don't understand how people who are against vaccines, look at the facts and blatantly ignore them. These people who have decided against vaccines are putting their child at a much higher rate of being diagnosed with these diseases which can cause a lot of pain, discomfort and life long side effects. If there is anything that I want people to take away from this article, it would be to put your child's safety before your believes.",,,,,,,
"Baseless anti-vaccine propaganda, non-fatal effects should also be considered (see my post on shingles as a result of chickenpox).  Even with better hygiene, these diseases were epidemic in the US before targeted vaccinations.  Polio is so insidious that it's presence anywhere is cause for concern anywhere.  As for measles, look at the transmission from unvaccinated foreign visitors.  Your smoking analogy is irrelevant and indicates severe non-current health information.",,,,,,,
"Chris you do realize that even at the height of the measles that much less than 1% of children actually died from the measles?  You do also realize that this country should be more focused on the rate of obesity in children as diabetes in children is at epidemic rates?<br/><br/>You do also realize that those of us who oppose mandatory vaccinations aren't merely ""anto-vaxxers"" but people who actually care about the health and well being of our own children and want to make sure what we are putting in them wont' actually harm them?  You do also realize that there are more than 30,000 adverse reactions to vaccinations reported to VAERS and there are many more that go unreported?<br/><br/>You do realize that if you have the vaccination then you should not have anything to worry about based on your sole belief that vaccinating will prevent one from getting that disease?  You do also realize that not one person gets vaccinated because they care about the ""greater good"" but just the health of their own child to be protected against a specific disease??",,,,,,,
"Do you understand how many of these diseases that are vaccinated against are transmitted? The vast majority are not due to poor hygiene. Certainly, improvements in public health have greatly reduced the incidence many diseases which do transmit via the fecal-oral route, most notably cholera- which, you will note, does not have a vaccine available. Most of these vaccine-preventable diseases are spread from person to person in airbourne drops, or by touching infected surfaces- the same way the common cold and flu are transmitted. Seeing as your typical adult gets 2 colds per year and child 6-8 per year in our modern era of public health than it is pretty clear that these can still be pretty easily spread.<br/><br/>Not to mention, several of these vaccine preventable diseases were just epidemic recently. Large polio outbreaks occurred in the 1950s- not a time I would consider a time when ""open defecation"" was exactly a problem. Hib and pneumococcus? The 1980s-90s, again not exactly a time where our standards of public health greatly differed from today. ",,,,,,,
"I want the option to accept or refuse medical interventions for myself and my children.   I don't appreciate elected officials lying and misrepresenting the truth in order to gain favor with corporations who will give them large sums of money.   I really have great disdain for a government funded agency entrusted with public health policy accepting large sums of money from the very people they are supposed to be regulating.    <br/><br/>I don't see anywhere in my post I suggest that I count for more than everyone else around me.  I do question why the author of this article omitted where breakouts of Mumps and Pertussis have occurred among 100%  vaccinated populations.  Maybe that lawsuit regarding the efficacy of the mumps vaccine is valid!   I do question the motives of Senator Pan who's previous law was already working, and pbe rates have been falling, I especially wonder why the mainstream media isn't reporting on the major alligations of fraud and coverup made against the CDC by one of it's researchers, even when statements to that effect were entered into the congressional record by Congressman Posey on July 29th of this year.

"If vaccines are so safe and effective then why are they harmful to those with weakened immune systems?  If vaccines are so safe then why does this country which requires the most infant vaccination have one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the civilized world?<br/><br/>Why can't we wait until at least 3 years old to start vaccinations when a child's brain has had a little time to develop?<br/><br/>Why are there 30,000 reports to VAERS of adverse reactions to vaccines which is probably under-reported?  Why can't I sue a pharmaceutical company if I feel my child was harmed by the vaccination?",,,,,,,
"The inevitable comments about how you can't trust any of the mountains of data on the safety or efficacy of vaccines are always some of the most ridiculous. Drug companies make their money on $20 pills that people take for arthritis or cholesterol once a day, not a $20 tetanus booster they take once every ten years. Treating single studies about the supposed new effectiveness of some new drug with skepticism is completely reasonable, doing the same for the 500th study on the effectiveness of MMR is something else.<br/><br/>In addition, it's not like most of the vocal vaccine opponents aren't trying to peddle something. When Wakefield published the fraudulent vaccine/autism study that eventually lost him his medical license, it was partly motivated by him trying to market his own alternative. Virtually all of the web sites pushing this stuff are also trying sell ""natural"" or ""homeopathic"" remedies that are untested and unregulated. The people selling the snake oil and magic beans have no less profit motive than the people selling the medicine.",,,,,,,

Also, the membership of the publisher in the Open Access community was suspended for 6 months in 2013 because of significant failures in their peer review process.

I fully believe in making an informed decision about vaccination. That's why I took several classes at a local university on immunology. I also audited courses on epidemiology and have done extensive research. That includes talking extensively with researchers and physicians. Based on that I fully support vaccination. Why? Because I did the *real* research and the *real* hard work behind it. I didn't just go to Google and find people that agree with me. ,,,,,,,

"This is in reply to DH. Our country's demographics are changing and whether you are in agreement or not with immigration, many people are flocking here for a better life and job opportunities. Unfortunately, many are not vaccinated and do bring in diseases such as TB and measles. Their children go to our schools and interact in our towns. Combine those children along with anti-vaxer's children and we now have up to 50% of school age children in CA capable of spreading preventable diseases. Maybe 99.99% of your acquaintances got chickenpox and never died but as a teacher, I know of a few that have had serious complications. I also remember a few young teens dining of meningitis which is also now preventable. If you are willing to take the risks that these diseases carry, why are you not willing to take the slight risk vaccinations carry?",,,,,,,
"The easiest way to get parents to vaccinate their kids is to remove why it is they are concerned. Lack of transparency in the government is a big issue. If it's so important for people to vaccinate their children why is it that the CDC does not do a study comparing the autism rates of vaccinated vs non-vaccinated children. It would prove once and for all if vaccines are or are not the cause. It would end the debate. There are no ethics issues as there are over 1 million voluntarily unvaccinated children. They have been asked for years to do this study, but to this day they refuse.<br/><br/>Type this in the youtube search bar to see for yourself ""Congressional Autism Hearing Highlights 2 of 3"".<br/><br/>What people don't realize is that this study has NEVER been done. There are some studies that have been done on a single ingredient, but never one for vaccinated vs unvaccinated control groups. You have to ask yourself why.",,,,,,,

Only when he woke with a scarlet fever rash did we learn it was scarlet fever, which is easily treated with antibiotics. ",,,,,,,
"Valerie, you're right, they didn't get sick,  BUT they did test positive.

Citing from the Autism Speaks website: <br/><br/>""In the largest-ever study of its kind, researchers again found that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine did not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This proved true even among children already considered at high risk for the disorder. <br/><br/>In all, the researchers analyzed the health records of 95,727 children, including more than 15,000 children unvaccinated at age 2 and more than 8,000 still unvaccinated at age 5. Nearly 2,000 of these children were considered at risk for autism because they were born into families that already had a child with the disorder. <br/><br/>‚ÄúConsistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk,‚Äù the authors write. ‚ÄúWe also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD.‚Äù""",,,,,,,
"Can't we just round up all the anti-vaxers' families, quarantine them and expose them and their children to the preventable diseases on a rotating basis every few weeks until they have developed immunity from having those diseases which they believe to be less risky than the vaccines.

Got polio vaccine in first grade.<br/><br/>Of course I'm just fantasizing but so are they.",,,,,,,
"I can only speak for myself, a 75 year old still-healthy and intelligent woman, as to what I think has largely contributed to the growing skepticism around vaccines.  For starters, many of our solid beliefs in the institutions that we grew up with and cherished have been painfully shattered. We have seen the dark side of all of the foundational supports in our lives. The integrity of our religious institutions, our town and city crime protection systems, our food protection systems, our  food growing and animal raising systems, our banking systems, our pharmaceutical and research protocols and their impact on healthcare systems have been called into question as to their honesty- and necessarily so.  While a good scrubbing with soap and hot water is called for on all these fronts, it leaves large numbers of our nation stunned, confused and often at a loss on how to create a happy and healthy life for our children and grandchildren.  I‚Äôm saying that what we believed in has been turned on its head.  We all love and want to protect our children. But there is a wide-spread reasonable doubt of what we could once count on.<br/>Who knows who is right?<br/>All I know is it seems perfectly reasonable that parents everywhere have every right to make their own decisions about the safety of mandated and regulated health practices. We are truly not living in Kansas anymore, except the folks that are living in Kansas.  ",,,,,,,
"they make their money on government contracts.  GSK for example with the swine flu epidemic sold several million doses to New York State, France, Britain and Germany for a tidy some.  When the 'epidemic' proved a hoax...France, Britain and New york wanted their money back...several billion dollars worth.<br/>So don't tell me that fairy tale that the pharm does not make money on vaccines...nothing they do is without cost...or without profit in mind.  Nothing the vaccine producers do is 'not' profit driven. ",,,,,,,
"The problem is when you lump all potential vaccines. Vaccine researchers know that vaccines are a careful risk analysis that is not to be taken lightly. This is why not all possible vaccines are recommended in the USA, the risks of say yellow fever vaccine do not outweigh unless you visit a country where you are likely to be exposed. As we move towards a more educated society if doctors and scientists give the reason: ,""Just TRUST US."" it is likely that parents may lose faith in that reasoning.<br/>Another concern is that at what point does the risk/benefit assessment get manipulated by the financial interests of the system? In general vaccines are an expense that rarely leads to a windfall, but if newer, and newer vaccines end up being required that could manipulate the system where less and less vital vaccines become REQUIRED regardless of unlikely but serious risks.",,,,,,,
"Facts don't work. Science doesn't work. Experience and history doesn't work. Neither do authorities who've cared for children or done research studies. Neither do threats. And even the observation of  the pain and agony experienced by a child with measles or mumps or whooping cough or chicken pox doesn't have much effect. A sizable group of parents here in California insists that no matter what anyone says or shows or knows, it's still all really about their individualistic ""parental rights.""

"I love the single piece of non-sense"" that you choose to focus on rather than the vaccinated with mumps and pertussis""<br/><br/>Well, in fairness to me, it was essentially the only thing specific enough to focus on. Vague, uncited statements that these outbreaks infected some vaccinated people are essentially meaningless. No one contests that the effectiveness of vaccines is not 100%, which is why herd immunity is important. You implied that with the measles comparison that the MMR vaccine was not effective, when the most cursory statistical analysis showed the exact opposite. Good catch on me accidentally hitting the hyphen though.<br/><br/>""You really should look up the video of Congressman Posey on July 29th.""<br/><br/>Why would anyone look up the testimony of a Congressman, as opposed to the direct statements from Dr. Thompson and the journal involved, as cited above?

"My son missed all of school last year on the couch with nausea, low grade fever, and headache after receiving a number of vaccines I'd been delaying because he got sick much more often than other children and it could turn serious--two cases of pneumonia before the age of 2, once narrowly avoiding the hospital, for instance.  His pediatric practice had no explanation, except they ""know"" the vaccines could not have contributed.  They will not sign a medical exemption from further vaccines, and we live in California.  I am not anti-vaccine--I have two older daughters who are fully vaccinated.  But if I still had the choice not to further vaccinate my son, I wouldn't.  For now, under current law he can attend school next year under a personal beliefs exemption.  I am hoping that vaccine choice advocates can do something in the next year before the California mandate comes into effect to offer some protection to kids like mine who the medical profession does not recognize as having particular sensitivity to vaccines.  This grey area of whether vaccines are more harmful than helpful for certain children who are not unquestionably immuno-compromised (such as a cancer survivor) is not an issue I ever see addressed in the vaccine debates.

That said, vaccination should not be a 'choice,' except in exceptional circumstances--and not, the Church of I don't Believe in Vaccinations.  Visit the family plots in old churchyards and you will see tiny gravestones lined up, a baby or young child buried one after another, every year or so.  It is enough to make you weep, even at a 100-year remove.  How many families do you know today who have buried even one child?

Like the flu vaccine, these should be optional.  Even the pneumococcal vaccine is dubious.  Big phrama have been widely pushing anti-flu and bacterial vaccines that cover only a few strains.

"Why is it that measles transmitted naturally poses a health threat while measles transmitted via a syringe is thought to be a public health measure?  Both produce antibodies.  Naturally transmitted measles produces antibodies for life while the vaccine-induced immunity wears off.  The goal should not be to totally halt measles (you are getting the measles from the vaccine) but to introduce measures that reduce morbidity and mortality (hearing loss, death) from the measles.  Those measures are largely nutritional.  Ensure that every child receives adequate nutrition along with public hygiene and the health threats childhood viruses pose vanish.  That is why there are vaccine side effects.  The kids aren't adequately nourished and they don't develop adequate antibodies and experience side effects.  The current vaccine mandates represent nothing more than fascism in medicine.  ",,,,,,,

"A large part of the problem is the lack of cultural memory. Few of today's new parents can remember anyone having died or suffering from the diseases that the immunizations are for. It is easy to forget that the pathogens are alive-and-well in the environment.<br/><br/>Like Brody, I contracted many of these diseases and was not only very ill but almost died from complications of the measles. I knew children who died from Whooping Cough, Polio, and other diseases that we now have vaccinations to prevent. <br/><br/>Perhaps these anti-vaccination parents should visit the third world nations where these diseases are still rampant and watch children die from preventable diseases that they won't get their children vaccinated against.<br/><br/>What I find strange is that if a parent allows their child to be unattended for a few minutes they can be charged with child endangerment, while at the same time they endanger their child by avoiding vaccinations just because they don't like them. Perhaps the parents of all the children who contracted measles should be charged with child endangerment just like the parents who let their children play in the park without supervision.",,,,,,,
"Queen, again why do you people think anyone gets vaccinated to not endanger others?  People vaccinate to protect themselves, period.  If people cared about other people then we would not have murderers, rapists, muggings, robbings, drunk drivers, wreckless drivers, smokers, drinkers, drug users, etc.  People care about themselves so stop pretending we are in fantasy world where people are vaccinating for the benefit of others!",,,,,,,
"Jane did not mention that Whooping Cough is also being reported in those of us who are in our 50's and 60's and were vaccinated as kids.  We need to be revaccinated.

Whooping cough is something that those of us in our 60s were never vaccinated against as children.

What is it you see that's so terrible among your fellow man? You've probably been vaccinated yourself - what exactly is wrong with you that makes you wish you hadn't been?<br/>2)  If vaccines ""cause"" autism, how exactly do they do that? What is the chemical agent universally present in all vaccines, and what is the mechanism by which it ""causes"" autism to develop? And, why do the vast majority of children who get vaccinated NOT get autism?<br/>3) If the reason diseases were eradicated is not due to vaccines but rather to better hygiene, as so many of you argue, why did certain previously eradicated diseases COME BACK in the U.S.? Are we all suddenly living in filth?",,,,,,,

However in speaking with her and commiserating, she told me of one patient she has met in treatment who has contracted shingles at the age of 16! This means the child was not vaccinated, and endured the initial illness, and now the pain of shingles and the possibility of several months of  lingering neuropathic pain once the outbreak is over.

"Yes, if we all just ate right and took our vitamins, no one would get sick!  Good nutrition and public hygeine predated the vaccine by many years:  people still died, were disabled, and caused children born with birth defects.<br/>Shots do not ""give measles,"" they use a killed vaccine.  ""Public hygeine"" will not prevent measles; it is an especially virulent virus that is transmitted via aerosol and persists in the air.

"You clearly have not studied science as demonstrated by the remarkable factual errors you make.<br/>1. You don't get measles from the vaccine. You develop immunity without getting the disease.<br/>2. The goal IS to totally halt measles.<br/>3. Good nutrition doesn't prevent measles.<br/>4. Vaccine side effects are not related to measles. You need to explain what ""side effects"" you are concerned with. A sore arm? A low grade fever?<br/>5. Your equating vaccine mandates with ""fascism"" belies a staggering misunderstanding of both science and history.",,,,,,,
Is it possible that large numbers of unvaccinated children could cause a mutation that infects those who were vaccinated but have become vulnerable to the mutated form of disease?   I have no medical expertise so perhaps this is not a valid concern.,,,,,,,
The resurgence of pertussis is due to failure of the current vaccine. Individuals who are vaccinated can become infected and be asymptomatic carriers. It has nothing to do with people who are unvaccinated.,,,,,,,
Whooping cough today is caused by the current vaccine. Vaccinated individuals become asymptomatic carriers and infect other people. That means that babies who contract whooping cough could have caught it from vaccinated siblings and/or parents.,,,,,,,
You need to look at the all cause mortality rates in industrialized nations before vaccines and you will see that they had declined to almost zero. Look up Dissolvingillusionsions.com.,,,,,,,

"And with children no longer getting chicken pox when properly vaccinated, when they are elderly and in poor health they will NOT get shingles - one cannot get it unless one has had chicken pox.  <br/><br/>For many, many elderly people, shingles is an agnoizing disease.  It can also attack the young who may have a poor immune system - I got shingles the first time when I was only 13.  I got it yet again about 14 years ago.  Thank heavens for Big Pharma having developed anti-viral treatments which avoided the terrible side effects of shingles which can last for decades.",,,,,,,
"As a a person who was vaccinated yet still got the diseases, I did not vaccinate my 3, now adult offspring. My youngest 's college required MMR titer, which revealed immunity to measles &amp; mumps (there's been no rubella in the U.S. for a number of years, so the CDC claims its eradicated).

"I wonder how many of the anti-vaccination mothers work outside the home?  When I was a child and got all the usual diseases, most mothers didn't work.  Even then, with 3-4 children, it was pretty awful being tied down at home for weeks while each child came down with the disease.  <br/><br/>Just how would that play out today?  Most employees now give a certain amount of time off and it is to be used as vacation or sick leave- employees choice.  One could go through all that leave VERY quickly with 2-3 children having just one childhood disease.  Will the gov't then have to intervene and insist on unlimited paid leave for a parent whose child has a preventable disease?  <br/><br/>Between the age of 6 and 14, I had 4 different childhood diseases, each requiring a minimum of 7-10 days out of school.  Good thing I was an only child!  My own children had chicken pox, vaccinations being available for all the other childhood diseases.  That was about 4 weeks out of my life!  <br/><br/>Of course, my 4th grade classmate who got polio missed nearly a year of school and his mother continued to have to help him until he was grown.  He walked with braces and on crutches - now in a wheel chair for years.  I remember him as such a handsome, fun-loving boy - very active.  He became a very serious boy and man.  Who could possibly take the risk of such a horrible disease with life-time consequences?  When the child becomes an adult, how does a parent justify such a choice that changed that child's life forever?",,,,,,,
"I'll add another idea:<br/>If a parent refuses to have his/her child vaccinated, then treatment for any disease preventable by vaccine up to the appropriate age of the child [on AMA recommended schedule] is not covered by health insurance. The parents will have to pay for all medical treatment if their child contracts a disease because the child was not vaccinated. If you're a parent who chooses to play roulette with your child's health, then you will have to pay when your child loses.<br/><br/>Money is a powerful incentive to Americans.",,,,,,,
"John Stewart said it best when he characterized parents who won't  vaccinate their children as ""mindfully ignorant.""  This is an astute observation.",,,,,,,
"Nobody refuses to immunize their children for lack of facts. But, record, here : the vaccine schedule now contains many less antigens than 40 years ago. Antigens cause some of the problems with vaccines like fever and seizures. So vaccines are safer than in the past. Vaccine refusal is more of a gut, emotional response to Weird Science. There is a strong current of distrust in socieaty. We don't trust politicians, police, or Doctors. Nobody is convinced to change their mind about something the believe by arguing, shouting, or ,the facts. To convince people to vaccinate their children we must convince parents that we share their concern. We must tell them we are concerned, like them, for all children and value each life, just like they do. The risks to their children need to be explained because they are real and very dangerous. Alternative vaccine schedules have been suggested as safer. We need to point out that the schedules have never been studied and leave their children at risk for serious consequences. By stressing values like these maybe some people will understand that we really mean to ""do no harm"" which has been the physicians first and foremost duty since ancient times.

Those vaccines that have saved millions of lives-- By bringing in these ""optional vaccines"" that don't really run a huge risk of killing immunocompromised individuals in your community, you are completely missing the point of the article and conflating the issue as a whole.  In short,  unfounded fears based on shoddy science should not be allowed to put the lives of children (yours and other people's) at risk.",,,,,,,
"Very sorry to hear about your son. As a mother, it is terrible to have to watch your children suffer.  As you may know, vaccines do not come with zero risks but very low risks and you seemed to have ended up on the unlucky end of the spectrum.  In cases like yours where there is a likely reaction from a vaccine, what would be a solution you would like to be put into place for outliers such as your son?",,,,,,,
"When my children, who are now 43 and 45, were infants, some pediatricians were still vaccinating against small pox.  I well remember my children's pediatrician recommending that they NOT be vaccinated against small pox unless they would be traveling to a country where this disease was still active.  At that time, the risk of side effects of that particular vaccine were far greater than the risk of them getting small pox.  I did not vaccinate them.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could again wipe out yet another childhood disease so vaccination would no longer be necessary!  <br/><br/>Many, if not most, of the most vocal anti-vax people are wealthy and highly educated.  They also travel a great deal and take their children in order to expose them to more of the world than the US.  I always wonder if they do decide to vaccinate against diseases that are a problem in the countries they visit, or do they take unvaccinated young children there and put them at great risk of harm?  <br/><br/>As a contemporary, age wise, of Ms Brody, I, too had measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox.  I avoided scarlet fever and whooping cough, diphtheria etc.  I well remember getting my first polio shot - I must have been about 10.  My mother lived in great fear of polio as a classmate got it, and the twin daughters of a co-worker of my father both got it, one ending up in an iron lung for decades.  Can one imagine having a child get polio today?  Are there even any iron lungs left in the US?  No thanks.",,,,,,,
"When my mother was in first grade, she got a measles vaccination.  Her kindergarten-age sister was so upset about the needle that my grandmother let her skip it.  My mother never got measles, but her little sister did, and died of complications.  That death devastated the family, and cast a long and terrible shadow over my mother's life.  Over eighty years later, that darkness is still present, still causing pain.  <br/><br/>Mandatory vaccination would almost certainly have saved my aunt's life, and spared her whole family a lifetime of grief and guilt and suffering.",,,,,,,

"You are quite right, and I depend on parents of children who can be safely vaccinated to protect him from exposure, just like the parents of a cancer survivor do.  The point of my note is that he is one of the children who cannot be vaccinated without adverse consequences, but he is not recognized as such even after missing a year of school.  There is no bright line between ""immunocompromised"" and ""not immunocompromised,"" yet his doctors will not even report his situation to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System because, in circular reasoning, they have never seen such a report.

"Bill Sardi, do you understand how vaccination works? A percentage of those vaccinated will have imperfect immune reactions to the vaccine, leaving them vulnerable.  No one claims vaccines are 100% effective, although that's what anti-vaxxers demand.  The way to eradicate an illness in a population is to minimize possible hosts, but due to the vagaries of the human immune system, they cannot ever be entirely eliminated.",,,,,,,
"G, I do have the common good in mind when I vaccinate myself and my family. I don't want to give the flu to an elderly person or pertussis to an infant.  What does that make me, some kind of unicorn?  I think people are more civic-minded than you may believe.",,,,,,,
"This is not a black and white thing. ""Vaccines are safe"" and ""vaccines cause Autism"" are equally disingenuous claims. Vaccines are not created equal, nor are all human bodies. Mandating vaccines is wrong and if you can't prove that they are  and effective, then DO MORE RESEARCH proving they are. Until then there needs to be choice. Bodily integrity must count here.<br/>Also, Dr. Offitt has some pretty lovely financial incentives for promoting vaccines. I don't trust his opinion. ",,,,,,,
Where in the world did you get your information?  Whooping cough IS NOT caused by the current vaccine.  The current vaccine DOES NOT contain any bacteria that can cause disease.  It has a small amount of protein that is injected so the body can develop antibodies to prevent disease.<br/>Please do your research before you open your mouth or your hand to type.,,,,,,,
If vaccines are so safe and effective then why are they harmful to those with weakened immune systems? I would be happy to explain this! There's a simple and clear answer! But I suspect id never convince you no matter WHAT I said....,,,,,,,
"In a previous Times article about controversies regarding vaccination, a commenter to the article reported that his grandparents had to watch helplessly as 4 of their children died from whooping cough within 24 hours.<br/>My God, what a tragedy! <br/><br/>Even with antibiotic therapy today, children struggling with the secretions of whooping cough can turn blue - and die. And how can any ""intelligent"" parent possibly pretend to be unaware of the panic and tragedy of the polio epidemic in this country in the mid-1900s. <br/><br/>Refusing to vaccinate your own child, by hiding behind the protection of herd immunity, not only plays Russian roulette with your child's health, but also is a betrayal of shared responsibility for the common good. ""Healthy Eating"" can help to strengthen the immune system, but it can not provide a death-proof suit against many powerful epidemic disease organisms. ",,,,,,,
" ""Mandating vaccines is wrong and if you can't prove that they are and effective, then DO MORE RESEARCH proving they are.""....A very large body of research has proved they are effective.

"As a a person who was vaccinated yet still got the diseases, I did not vaccinate my 3, now adult offspring......Your reaction was exactly backwards. Precisely because vaccines are not 100% effective it is even more important that every child should be vaccinated so that those few who do not establish protective antibody titers are protected by herd immunity. ",,,,,,,
"Pertussis vaccine is not live virus/bacteria vaccine (are there any live bacteria vaccines? Don't think so). In any case, these vaccines ALWAYS require boosters.  Doesn't mean the vaccine doesn't work. Schedules need to be followed, including in adulthood. All adults, but especially those around babies and children, need to get a TdaP - for themselves and the children they could infect. ",,,,,,,
Laura - Prior to their release the vaccines are determined to be safe and effective by the FDA. Safe and effective in the sense that the potential benefit greatly outweighs the possible associated risk. Under those circumstances it is hard to imagine how anyone should be able to successfully sue the drug company for negligence. What did the drug company do that was wrong? ,,,,,,,

No, the doctor cannot tell you that the vaccine is perfectly safe, but he can tell you how a sane person should bet.",,,,,,,
AJK- You seemed not to figure out that by doing so it would pretty much make the schools comply regardless of how the anti-vax parents felt.  The vast majority of people support vaccination efforts and if the anti vax parents didn't like the school's requirement of the 95% threshold then they would leave and probably home school.  So no need for your concerns or critique.,,,,,,,

The people against vaccinating their children are just too young to have seen the reality of a measles epidemic - or diphtheria or polio - they haven't seen little kids with those pathetic skinny legs and small, heartbreaking crutches they had to use.

"One of the things I often notice about the writing of forced-vaxxers is the frequent attempts to provoke fear among readers.

Thus a common, almost always mild viral infection that nearly everyone over fifty experienced as a normal childhood event becomes ""misery incarnate,"" complete with visions of ""flesh eating bacteria."" Makes ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" seem tame by comparison. Yet it's strange. There is no mention in this piece of the over $3B in compensation that the federal Vaccine Court has paid out to the families of horrifically vax injured children. No reason to scare the public, after all. Curiously missing also is any shout out to the U.S. Congress, who quite generously has provided absolute immunity to suit to vax manufacturers for death and injury their products cause. No, we sure wouldn't want to alarm the public with that little piece of information. Golly gee, some of them might start thinking for themselves after learning that. Then we have Dr. Paul ""10,000-Vax"" Offit, who famously claimed that babies could receive 10,000 shots at once. We definitely wouldn't want anyone to know about the cool $42M the good doctor made off his rotavirus vaccine patent, or how he sat on the very same CDC committee that ""recommended"" this proprietary invention to every kid in America.

"First let me say I am not against vaccines. Despite being one of those 90% who survived measles without any problem (no vaccine, I'm that old), a 10% complication rate is very high. Mumps also has a high complication rate and the risk to unborn children from rubella is unacceptable. Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccines are no-brainers (adults, get your TdaP, save yourself from months long coughs and save any babies you encounter from whooping cough).  Hib has prevented meningitis in babies.<br/>But I am concerned about some of the other recommendations -<br/>Varicella vaccine under age 12 - in healthy children, complications are very low and exposing adults who have had chicken pox could reduce shingles (see England's NHS who do not immunize until over 12 without disease). One of the main reasons for recommending was economic (missed work). On the other hand, with immune suppressed around us (organ transplants,...), defensible.<br/>Rotavirus - in US, morbidity low - risk vs benefit?<br/>Hep B - maybe should be targeted?<br/>Etc.<br/>But, in most states, requirements for immunization for school are the same for chicken pox as measles.

Brody<br/>I recently heard that parents have stopped getting their children vaccinated so I thought I would read this article to understand why. The article says that some parents are misinformed and choose to not get their child the shot despite the doctor saying it is good for them. It also says ""some parents balk at the seemingly large number of vaccines administered to young children, who can get as many as 23 shots by age 2."" The children need that many because that is when the risk is the highest. One other thing that seemed interesting was that some people belive in herd immunization, this is when the people around you are safe so you are to even though you were the only one to not get vaccinated. They are taking action though California now doesn't allow children to go to school without the immunization.",,,,,,,
"Jane, I read your books back in the 70's &amp; 80's. Your insights were helpful at a time when the wisdom of vibrant health was rare. I've followed the vaccination controversy for 40 years. My child (now 35) and grandchild were never vaccinated. Why? What I find very disturbing these days, in this massive mud-slinging affair, is that the conversation that SHOULD be front and center NEVER HAPPENS. Body ecology is a PRIMARY issue. Never a mention of acid-alkaline balance, deficiencies, impacted colons, the micro-biome, or clogged lymph, etc. Suzanne Humphries has done an incredible job in her book 'Dissolving Illusions', pointing to the wretched conditions in crowded cities that set the stage for the global 'epidemics' of the past. Tainted water, no refrigeration, no fresh food, rotting teeth, NO sanitation, horse manure everywhere, etc. When THE FACTS are not part of discussions, like the horrific INGREDIENTS in vaccines, shot directly into infants‚Äô bloodstreams, and the FACT that PRIVATE courts try cases of vaccine damage (and the parents win), well yes, I'm speechless!  (Some) media channels earn millions from Big Pharma. I've met with parents of autism. There‚Äôs NO QUESTION that vaccines are implicated, but the media always shoots down that argument. Read ""Dissolving Illusions"", as anyone who disagrees with my rant should do. You'll think differently. Body ecology is everything. I rest my case (again). Search for Suzanne on YouTube. Another great source is <a href=""http://www.wddty.com"" title=""www.wddty.com"" target=""_blank"">www.wddty.com</a>.",,,,,,,
"Actually, Kathi, given the reduced efficacy of antibiotics against common strep strains, you make a really good argument for developing a vaccine against strep. Let's get started!",,,,,,,
"Exactly.  People need to continue framing this debate in ethical and moral terms.  Those who refuse to vaccinate their children are acting purely in their own self-interest, with no regard for the interests of other individuals or society at large.  And yet, at the same time, they expect to reap the benefits of a herd immunity that we (the vaccinated) provide to them and their children. It is the definition of both selfishness and hypocrisy. The ironic thing is that most of the anti-vaxxers I've personally met are socially liberal and just in most other views, which in my mind, makes their decision to prioritize their own child above all other children even more hypocritical. I guess conscientiously recycling and expressing socially just opinions on Twitter provides them with the moral security that they can be a tad selfish in *this one* area. My guess is that once the anti-vaxxers drive herd immunity so low that we have more frequent outbreaks of measles, mumps, pertussis, etc. (and the resultant deaths), they will be *running* to the doctor to get their children vaccinated.  There's a reason almost everyone I've talked to over age 60 or so is bewildered by the anti-vaxxers.  Why in the world would we want to go back to a time when children died of preventable diseases?

"Unless a vaccine uses a live virus, you cannot get the disease from a vaccine. You can only get the immune response. Disease is the actual infection of cells with viruses, which co-opt the cellular process and produce more viruses, generally explodes the cell, releasing more viruses which in turn infect and destroy other cells. Immune response is the creation of antibodies triggered by the foreign protein surrounding the virus. No cells are infected. No viruses reproduce. No cell, tissue or organ damage follows from viral reproduction. Immune responses may make you feel ill - because your temperature rises or your muscles ache, for instance - but you have not been infected with the disease.",,,,,,,
"Valerie, I am an anti-vaxxer, and have been for 40 years. I work in the alternative medicine field. My child and grandchild were never vaccinated. I know dozens of anti-vaxxers. We are mostly VERY well informed. I beg you to read the work of Suzanne Humphries - ""Dissolving Illusions"". Vaccines - for the most part - defy logic and the laws of natural hygiene. That's a bold statement, I know. But when internal body ecology is not part of the discussion, (as it almost never is in conventional medicine), then what are we doing and saying really? That a truly healthy body cannot remain healthy? As a biologist you would know that viruses and bacteria (and cancer) will thrive in an acidic environment, devoid of proper nutrients. Let's begin these discussions with the Laws of Natural Hygiene, yes? ",,,,,,,
"One would think that after 50 years on the job, this author would have knowledge of information about vaccines beyond what the US government and the media say.  It is so trite and uninformed that the writer could be still living in 1955.

"HN you failed to read what I stated.  A study of vaccinated vs unvaccinated.  The study in JAMA was done on people that had some or all of their MMR shots and was not done on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated control groups.  Now ask yourself why such an obvious study has never been done.  Perhaps it's because those in charge already know what the outcome would be.  There are thousands upon thousands of videos on youtube where parents state they had a normal child until vaccinations.  Some of those stating their child regressed into autism only hours after vaccinations.  Just type in #cdcwhistleblower or #hearthiswell into the youtube search bar and watch hours upon hours of observational evidence.<br/><br/>In February of this year the CDC whistle blower Dr WIlliam Thompson was granted immunity.  He stated the the CDC intentionally hid evidence that vaccines caused autism. You would think such an important admission would be investigated as soon as possible, after all we now have over 4.6 million with autism in this country...nothing.<br/><br/>People who ignore the overwhelming evidence that vaccines cause autism are responsible for perpetuating the worst tragedy man has ever seen.  Millions of lives destroyed and it's all about one thing...greed.",,,,,,,
" Every individual is different and all of these Vaccine Preventable Diseases have different characteristics, symptoms, and means of being transmitted.  And that is to say nothing of the fact that 'time' affects all of these viruses. To make a blanket statement claiming that getting an injection in hopes of future immunity is always safer, is not necessarily logical if it is no present risk of contracting a virus exists in the present. Nor would that be a logical statement without indications that it might again become a clear and present danger.  For instance, a polio epidemic will never again occur in the US regardless of future rates of vaccination because during a comprehensive campaign to eradicate polio from our environment we, concurrent to vaccination, also eliminated sanitation practices that had allowed for its transmission.  Nobody in America without an immunity is at all likely to ever even have a chance to come into contact with the polio virus itself even if someone with polio visits our country because unlike 60 years ago, we don't use non-chemically treated public latrines nor do we anywhere in America dissipate untreated raw sewage into water which people might later have contact with.  We also don't have Diphtheria here for much of the same reasons.  Rubella, which also isn't presently endemic, was never a devastating disease to already-born children.  Blanket statements simply don't apply to individuals. ",,,,,,,

A day before she was due to get her Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine, a friend with an autistic child urged me to skip the vaccine. She said that being developmentally delayed, my baby was at a higher risk for injury than a healthy baby. I promptly called my baby's neurologist and developmental pediatrician. I got essentially the same response from both:<br/><br/>""You must vaccinate. The risk to your baby from the illnesses is far greater that any risk from the vaccination and is the same as for any other baby""<br/><br/>Within about 12 days, my daughter, who had had a normal EEG at ten months, began having epileptic seizures.

"Out of over 350 million Americans that have lived over the last 15 years, this woman was only the 4th to die while infected with measles.  The other 3 to have died were also severely immune compromised.  The severely immune compromised have always been a part of the statistics that show that 99.7% of those who contract measles do not die from measles. <br/><br/>The concept of 'herd immunity' is utterly irrelevant inside a hospital which is where it was she contracted a case of measles and where we can't even rule out that she wasn't infected by a recently vaccinated person and we shouldn't be so daft as to ignore that possibility as hospitals warn families against allowing the recently vaccinated from coming into contact with their immune compromised patients.  <br/><br/>She didn't catch measles out on the street but instead inside a hospital where she had been for some time, and where she was already terribly sick and fighting for her life with a very poor prognosis as it was.  That Seattle Times article is full of subjective conjecture. <br/><br/> It's virtually impossible to even know if the case of measles discovered only at her autopsy, and which hadn't developed symptoms, was the cause of the pneumonia which killed her and which itself could have been caused by any number of other viruses she was also afflicted with. <br/><br/>To panic as we're being encouraged to do is silly as our odds are less than 1 million to 1 divided by .3% morbidity or even less than .3% if we're not immune compromised.",,,,,,,

"My brother is autistic.   Early in our childhood, someone suggested that my brother's periodic episodes of violent behavior were caused by food allergies.   After every episode, my mother would identify something he'd eaten in the past few weeks and announce that he was allergic to it, because ""that was the only thing that's different, so it must have caused it.""   And that's fine -- except once a food fell under her suspicion, she couldn't let it go, even when the next episode occurred after months without the suspected food.  <br/><br/>Scientific arguments about the nutritional content of the forbidden food or the nature of food allergies had no effect on her suspicion, because they didn't address the root problem:  my mother's need for a plausible explanation for my brother's problems and a safe, effective treatment for them.  <br/><br/>This article won't change anyone's mind about vaccinations because it doesn't address the fundamental problem.  Anti-vaxxers are afraid that their children will be permanently injured with a condition, such as autism, whose causes are not understood and has no effective treatments. Like my mother, they need an explanation that gives them hope.  They will cling to one that makes sense to them, no matter what kind of evidence to the contrary is presented, until a better one comes along.   <br/><br/>Stopping the anti-vax movement requires a better explanation of autism, and not, unfortunately, arguments about the importance and safety of childhood vaccinations.",,,,,,,

"I'm 64 years old, and have been an ""anti-vaxxer"" for 40 years. I have an unvaccinated 35 year old son, and 7 year old unvaccinated daughter - both in perfect health - healthier than most. As a family we understand lymphology, as every kindergartener should, but it's not taught in school. I have studied this topic for 4 decades, read several books on the subject, and I personally know at least 40 people who did not vaccinate their children, and we all know there are millions of anti-vaxxers worldwide. The FACTS are wrapped in a cloud of mysterious mis-information, media hype and Big Pharma agenda. If you want the FACTS, begin by reading 'Dissolving Illusions' by Suzanne Humphries, the latest unbiased rational study of the subject. I, and my family, feel well protected simply by eating clean healthy food, no junk, fresh air, sunshine, and supplements. Sounds too easy? If I lived with tainted water, no sanitation, no refrigeration, no fresh food, rats, no oral hygiene, etc. NO vaccine would protect me from deadly diseases, especially if my internal ecology was ripe for germs to take root. The millions who died in these 'epidemics' mostly lived in horrid urban living conditions, overcrowded with vermin all around them. Polio affected less than 1% of the population, and most fully recovered. Polio comes from fecal-oral contamination (poor sanitation/tainted food/no clean water, and most people do not know this. NOBODY talks about this obvious primary issue. ",,,,,,,
"No, most know that they are not 100% safe by a long shot, the puzzle is in how some attempt to pass off vaccines as if they are.  But other than vaccines NO ONE is trying to force me to take ANY medication or medical product against my will, no matter my reasons.  Caution should be exercised with ANY substance that is allowed into the human body.  What is fine for one may be poison to another.  Funny how vaccines are the only one that we are suppose to give a free pass.",,,,,,,
"Oh please tell me you are not this na√Øve?  What we thought we knew 20 years ago is laughable today.    We use the term ""tobacco science"" when referencing science that has been manipulated, bought and paid for, to benefit corporations, not people.  We have agencies in the U.S. with a history of backing corporate products both before and after knowing those products would cause harm and even death.  We have agencies that have conducted human experiments on Americans without their consent and we are not talking ancient history here, but as recent as the 1990s.  We have agencies who have hidden the truth from the public to protect ""the program"" knowing people would be injured and even die.  SV40 and Factor VIII are just two examples.<br/>It is not a conspiracy to see clearly that corporation are running this country, writing legislation, buying politicians, lying about their own studies and data if the fines are less than the profit.  With vaccines every single safeguard once in place has now crumbled and there is nothing left except concerned parents, so instead of fixing the system, they are going to remove the last safeguard standing.  Good luck with than one.",,,,,,,
"This kind of opt out has always been available throughout the history of vaccines.  You yourself went to school with unvaccinated kids, ""Oh the horror"" and you just didn't have a clue.<br/>I was never vaccinated in my entire life and went to public school but no one gave a crap because this type of fear mongering was simply not the norm back then.  In the 60s the first round of almost any brand new vaccine, was disastrous.  The first Polio vaccine...""look up the Cutter Incident"".  The first measles vaccine...a similar disaster.  So in the 60s most kids still had natural measles, mumps, chicken pox, etc.  In the 70s there was still a lot of suspicion and many families simply didn't do it.  In the 80s the pressure increased and a few new vaccines were added.  The rates were still much lower than they are today.  Only the last 2 decades have seen this fanatical approach to an ever increasing vaccine schedule.<br/>So much different than you believe, we actually now...today...have the most highly vaccinated population in the history of our nation.  More children are vaccinated than ever in history and with more and more vaccines.  More adults are vaccinated because they never had the natural illness and vaccine immunity wanes.  So the fact is that people are over-reacting to the lowest level of vaccine refusers and exemptors in the our history is almost humorous.  In California the new legislation goes after less than 1% of children that are completely unvaccinated...yes less than 1%. ",,,,,,,
"Well then you get all the vaccines too.  See that is the problem here.<br/>According to the CDC there is no valid reason for medical exemptions.  A few temporary ones, but then it's every vaccine for them too.  Only children with the ""bubble boy"" disease get a pass from CDC, all others are to be vaccinated.  Cancer patients, transplant patients, immunocompromised besides ""bubble boy"" well you too.  This one-size-fits-all despite family history, despite previous vaccine reactions, despite serious illness, well those are the very reason people are rebelling.<br/>You can't sit and claim exemption while taking away my right to the same for what I think is just as valid a reason.  ",,,,,,,
"Yes a 5% failure rate for measles alone and yet those children are not going to be tested or discovered nor banned from school as perfectly healthy non-vaccinated children in California will be excluded.  So 5% that are unknown but a danger to others, including the immune compromised will be ignored while they witch hunt after less than 1% that are completely unvaccinated.<br/>They also ignored Teachers and other adults, typically 20% of the population of any school.<br/>Unvaccinated children were excluded from school during an outbreak, the adults and 5% without immunity will not be because we do not even know who they are, so they are actually more dangerous than the unvaccinated.  Apparently in California you get a free pass, just for attempting vaccination, no matter if you obtain immunity or not.  It all sounds like a pretty funny shell game if so many families were not being adversely affected I might even laugh about it.  ",,,,,,,
"Yes, Cory, thank you. I am talking about those who can't take vaccines, whether it's post-transplant or something similar; also appreciate your knowledge of the variety of ways vaccines can work.<br/><br/>There's no question there are some risks with anything we do or take - but science is firmly on the side of this issue, I believe. And as mentioned before, I think many don't remember the illness epidemics of the past. I surely hope we are not doomed to repeat them.",,,,,,,
"Well actually ... I was vaccinated for both measles and mumps as a child and I contracted both of these maladies. My diet, as a child growing up in an urban working class family, was sub-standard to say the least. For most victims - the vast majority - measles is not a serious condition and most recover with no lasting effects. And yes, today so many children today are fed on fast food, refined carbs, soda, sugar and rare non-organic fruit or veggie. Regarding the recent measles outbreak in Disneyland, a new study published in the journal 'JAMA Pediatrics' claims to delineate the source and spread of measles during the widely hyped Disneyland measles outbreak, of course blaming the unvaccinated for this ridiculous non-event. But the data points presented in the study reveal that the vast majority of those who caught measles had previously been vaccinated, and yet the outbreak is still somehow being blamed 100% on the unvaccinated. According to information from the study presented by California Healthline, as many as 86% of those who caught measles at Disneyland were fully up to date on their MMR vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella. This means that none of them should have gotten measles, if you believe the official story anyway. This was a microscopic tiny fraction of the general population.  The real danger here is the manipulation of facts by the powers that be - for profit. Not understanding this puts all of us in danger. ",,,,,,,
"There is NO conspiracy ... just a lack of accurate information across the board. MOST anti-vaxxers are very well informed, and that's why they choose to not vaccinate their kids (or their parents for that matter). The mention of Bill Maher merely points to the fact that there IS a controversy over what is called the 'germ theory'. Germ theory deniers (me and Bill and millions of others) simply understand that the 'germ' is not the issue. It's the internal ecology of the HOST that's the real issue. Some people get the flu, some don't. It's no accident. It's internal body ecology. Suzanne Humphries is one of thousands of doctors who have done their homework. Suzanne just happened to spend YEARS compiling the research, and published. Read the reviews at Amazon. ",,,,,,,

Why is that Paul Offit uses his name and affiliation and backs up his statements with his research but that you can't cite anything except a CDC report which actually undermines your ""theory"". ",,,,,,,
"That's reasonable, _after_ people accept that some vaccines can -- in principle -- be mandated.  But as long as the prevalent stance of the antivaxers is ""if there is _any_ risk there _must_ be an opt-out"", they will continue to be ignored. ",,,,,,,

I have yet to see a reference that in 1986 good ol' Ronald Reagan gave immunity to big Pharma and made them immune from being sued against vaccine injury.  I have yet to see a reference that 75 cents of every vaccine goes to the vaccine court system to PAY FOR VACCINE INJURIES.    Do your homework people.  Yes, I was vaccinated.  I had less then 10 vaccines in the late 60's and 70's, TOTAL.  Yes, I got the mumps and chicken pox, big whoop.  Somebody mentioned that it is an economic issue if you get these diseases because then somebody HAS TO STAY HOME.  Well, maybe you shouldn't have children if you cannot accommodate for these life events.  Things that make you go hmmmm/..........<br/>FYI...my child is 5.  She has not gotten sick at all.  No flu, no strep, no ear infections, no coughs.   When kids in her pre-school were dropping like flies from the flu, she was standing tall asking....""Mommy, why don't I get sick?"" No allergies, no auto immune issues, NOTHING.  To me, the risks of the vaccine far outweigh the benefits.  Have you ever read the insert of a vax vial?  EDUCATE YOURSELF before you point fingers.

What I have seen is that you NVIC  people-- using pseudoscientific nonsense and fear mongering--have driven down vaccine rates in the US, leading to large increases in outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, including measles, which had been declared eradicated in 2000.<br/><br/>I despise you NVIC people because you put my patients at risk and endanger public health in general.

"Why give vaccinations for what may seem like relatively low chances of getting a disease?  Several factors, including that a vaccine has finally been developed for a terrible disease, that those diseases are becoming much more prevalent as our societies and habits change, that as people become more mobile they may move to areas of the country where those diseases are much more common than they are where you live, that the time for best immunity may be as a youth rather than later, if at all.

"Google ""polio epidemic 1955"".  Then try looking up ""iron lung"". Then think about what used to be the norm for August, year after year. <br/><br/>Vaccination along with improved sanitation, provision of clean drinking water and mosquito control has done more to improve world population health than all high-tech medical interventions taken together. Your daughter is lucky and has a good immune system, clearly. Good thing, though, that the kids sharing her wading pool have been vaccinated against polio if you've managed to refuse to give her that one. August used to be a time of fear. <br/><br/>Some of these vaccines are more critical to receive than others for the recipient -  however you have a responsibility as a member of a community, however defined, to help maintain the herd immunity. You'd be singing a different tune if your child had an immune deficiency and couldn't mix with kids of other anti-vaxers like yourself or mingle in public in large groups of kids or if your child with rubella, which is mostly a nuisance to the afflicted child, managed to spread it to an immunodeficient pregnant woman - maybe a relative - who then bore a damaged child. Vaccinate untold millions of people and there will be a few bad outcomes but they pale in comparison to the mass illness and crippling that vaccination prevents. It's good policy to have a non-adversarial system to pay injury claims. You're the one who needs to do some learning.",,,,,,,

"Well, that's real strong science there, Beverly. Your 5-year-old didn't get vaccinated and hasn't gotten sick. One is not a very impressive sample size. I think you should have one, maybe even two more children in your scientific study in order to achieve statistical significance. Yeah, three ought to do it. Then you can publish it in a peer-reviewed journal. Extrapolate the results and the obvious conclusion would be that if nobody anywhere were vaccinated, no one would get sick -- and if by some fluke there were an outbreak of measles, mumps, polio or whatever, we could just put that in the ""big whoop"" category, as you termed it. Really, these sicknesses aren't that bad, are they? A little whooping cough never killed anyone (wait, actually it did... but those kids probably didn't hydrate enough or eat their veggies). And if your child gets sick and has to stay home from school, that's no big deal because, as you noted, a parent can just stay home with her or hire a babysitter while the sick child has loads of fun watching cartoons all day...maybe even catches up on her homework. And the sicknesses would improve her mental toughness as well, which would serve her well later in life, should she survive unharmed to adulthood (not all unvaccinated children do). And the same could be said for any other children your child infects with her preventable sickness. Why little children can't just suck it up and tough it out is beyond me.",,,,,,,

Exactly how many vaccinations and which vaccinations are parents opting out of? The media gives the impression that ""anti-vaxxers"" refuse all vaccines. This is simply false. The reality is most parents who obtain exemptions do vaccinate their children. In our case we stopped vaccinating after my son had a serious reaction to his MMR. We then tested for titers (he's immune) and obtained an exemption for the few remaining boosters he had left. I guess if push came to shove I'd have all of his titers tested although I've read schools won't accept titers for the DTaP. If titers aren't reliable for DTaP then you have to wonder how anyone vaccinated can prove immunity.<br/>Speaking of the DTaP, nice attempt at trying to blame the uptick in Pertussis on the unvaccinated.

Mercifully polio is though but not quite totally extinct worldwide - there are still some pockets of it in places where religious fanatics see vaccination as a Western plot.

Watching asthmatic children use every muscle to breathe in oxygen and no medications (or surgical intervention) will keep that child from dying.  Doctors in Syria are watching children die from starvation every day!  Die from mortar rounds.  They have no loving family to go home to...they only know that they will see death every hour, every day...sometimes not sleeping for 72 hours in a row.<br/><br/>I have patients dying of congestive heart failure as we have not kept up with a malady that will finally kill most Americans. CHF kills 287,000 patients a year!<br/><br/>I will always remember the day I was on my way to my first rural clinic..I was going to SAVE people!

The ""test"" is not on material that is not in the curriculum.<br/><br/>All this ""opting out"" is getting totally out of hand.  We have parents opting out of vaccinating their children, having them in public, private or parochial schools, and now testing.  Hey - can I just opt out of property taxes and income taxes?  Or can I opt out of the portion of my federal taxes goes to entitlements?

"A Milestone in Africa: No Polio Cases in a Year<br/><br/>The article that caught my attention this week was titled "" A Milestone in Africa: No Polio Cases in a Year."" The title is self explanatory. Polio is a contagious viral illness that can cause paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death.  Polio was a very common virus that has been spread around Africa. The most common area that was affected by polio was Nigeria. The country took a proactive approach in order to combat the disease.<br/>Officials finally took control of the situation by making sure that everyone was vaccinated. Officials even made sure that Africa was under surveillance by hiring thousands of community ""mobilizers"" to find anyone who hadn't been vaccinated. Because of all of there determination and dedication to fight the deadly virus, all of the hard work finally paid off.<br/>The virus hasn't been detected in a whole year. The last case of polio in Nigeria was recorded on July 24, 2014. However, the last case of polio in Africa was detected in Somalia on August 11, 2014 and their hasn't been a case of polio since then.<br/>Although the virus seems to be gone, many people are on edge. Africans are nervous that it may come back, but for now they are very hopeful that the virus is gone. I hope that there is a continued effort to maintain a healthy environment for Africans. ",,,,,,,
"Children Die Because People are Wrongly Afraid of Vaccines<br/><br/>This article accurately explained the exact ridiculous thought process some men and women go through in their decision of whether or not to receive the vaccination for illnesses like the flu. Though with some extreme cases, such as the Taliban gunmen who murder vaccination workers, there are more underlying problems than the mere fact they refuse to accept the concept of vaccination. However, when the average citizen across the country denies what could quite possibly save their life simply because they feel as if their religion prevents it, or because they are too closed-minded and skeptical to accept it, it becomes insufferable. Families all around keep their children from the vaccines, putting their lives at great risk. Aside from this, the article directly introduced the information at hand, rather than fluffing it up with an anecdote or something along those lines, which was a great tactic in keeping the readers interested and focused on the content. The article was undoubtedly written with support for the vaccination of all those who can get it, therefore, the author‚Äôs purpose for writing the article in the first place was clearly to inform readers about the seriousness of the cause. On the other hand, the approach taken in writing this did leave it slightly dry. In the final analysis, this article was highly informative, and worked well in providing the information that was intended. ",,,,,,,
"(A Milestone in Africa: No Polio Vaccines in a Year)Polio vaccines are vital in rural areas of Africa and also in other areas such as Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is why this really interested me. For a year, no cases of polio have been reported. Many organizations and the World's Health Organization decided to go into these areas where polio was persistent in attempts to eradicate it. Polio rates have gone down tremendously world-wide.<br/><br/>Though this is a huge step in the progression of eradicating polio, two more years must past before it becomes truly eradicated from Africa. I believe these efforts are saving lives and creating better futures for those in Africa and other countries without sufficient healthcare. It is just one step though,  into making these countries healthier. Politics must be involved to establish health care, but this is a humanitarian effort. One by one diseases and sicknesses should be tackled and helping the government's people and economy may help it to become a healthier country. ",,,,,,,
"This is not junk politics, but poisonous politics. One can at least enjoy (if fleetingly) the sweet taste of junk food and junk beverages; one cannot enjoy poison and what these Republican presidential candidates are doing to the discourse threatens to gravely weaken us if they ever had a chance to put it into practice. If you think that is hyperbole just listen to what ""rising star"" Carly Fiorina recently said about vaccinations. Or how Rick Perry has walked away from his own prior policy.<br/><br/>At times their criticism of the president's party's policies is beyond the pale (more often it is incoherent), but that's not the big problem. The big problem is that their prescriptions for ""making America great again"" are poisonous to all but a very narrow segment of the US populace... and Benjamin Netanyahu.",,,,,,,
"Woah, let's not let facts enter the discussion Anna! Better we continue to let this debate play out in the form of those with no medical expertise screaming at the top of their lungs about videos edited so heavily (by a serial liar) that they bear no resemblance to what was actually being discussed. <br/><br/>But, to be fair with regards to your point about vaccines, supposedly moderate Carly Fiorina did say yesterday that she thinks vaccinations should be a parent's choice. She further implied that it was bad that a doctor recommended her daughter get the cancer preventing (with zero long term side effects) HPV vaccine. Yet again republicans show that their form of ""freedom"" is the freedom to do whatever you want, however uneducated and stupid and disconnected from reality, with no concern whatsoever of the costs to your fellow citizens. <br/><br/>BTW, if republicans really want to stop abortions, the solution is easy, and it's been proven to work. Colorado implemented a long term contraception plan and as a result teen pregnancy and abortion rates both plummeted more than 35%. These republicans consider abortion murder, yet they're not willing to implement a plan that both saves money and drops the abortion rate 35%.<br/><br/>One gets the feeling it's the sex that matters to them (well, sex they're not having), as opposed to the fetuses as they claim.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/07/07/colorado-iud-long-term-birth-control-success-teen-pregnancy/29818499/"" title=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/07/07/colorado-iud-long-term-birth-control-success-teen-pregnancy/29818499/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/07/07/colorado-iud-lo...</a>",,,,,,,
"Dr. Charo has an opinion - that ""[t]he current campaign to discredit Planned Parenthood through its connection to fetal tissue research represents a betrayal of the people whose lives could be saved by the research and a violation of that most fundamental duty of medicine and health policy, the duty of care.""

That also does not make it so. Thoughtful people can differ on the subject, as this is a complex, morally fraught subject. But it seems we are in an ""I'm for X, and anyone disagreeing is evil, stupid, or a sheep."" I vaccinate my children, but I am still uncomfortable about the moral issues involved. The recent hidden camera videos, to me, display a group of Planned Parenthood employees that have lost sight of the humanity of the little donors involved. Perhaps they have hardened themselves out of necessity, or perhaps they just don't care. I can't answer that. But I think some introspection on the part of the employees might not be such a bad thing. If they spoke so casually about killing a lion in a particular way so as to maintain a beautiful skin, the outcry would be loud and vitriolic.",,,,,,,
"I am not sure about this thesis, but many people develop obsessive special interests or ideas and become zealous about them.  It can be a belief in a very particular diet as the only true path, a conviction that vaccinations are dangerous to children, or devotion to Star Trek.  There is a certain randomness determining which people fixate on some overpowering idea or interest, and on what it is.  One person became life long Buddhist after picking up a book in a bookstore in an academic town.  His big interest did no harm and was actually beneficial to many people.  It seemingly is almost like falling in love--a chemistry no one can really account for.  ISIS is on the internet, and there are going to be odd moments of chemistry that lead seemingly average people into a world of great danger to them, and barbaric harms to others.  Twenty years for two kids who got hit by the really wrong chemistry is a lot.  But their plans were atrocious.

If I were to write that it is impossible to model the collective economic behavior of 7 billion earthlings, and that therefore all economics is garbage, and no politician has an economic policy based on sound science, you can be sure it would provoke a reaction from millions of people who had heretofore not given it much thought, let alone collected any peer-reviewed data of their own.<br/><br/>One thing I can tell you is that relying on the scientific method will make you a lot less ignorant than those who don't.",,,,,,,
"The 1998 paper by Wakefield that supposedly sought to show a connection of vaccines and autism sought to do no such thing, and clearly states that they did not show a link of the MMR to the bowel condition (and not autism) under study. Wakefield, however, was so bold as to report that many parents of the children studied (some of whom were autistic) said symptoms began after MMR, and also cited other literature that reported onset of autistic symptoms after MMR.  He questioned the vaccine program and paid the consequences; you can make a very strong argument-- much too long to make here-- that the paper should be reinstated. ",,,,,,,
"Yes the limits of science and the uncertainty of much knowledge is crucial to effective understanding of the world, but there needs to be a corresponding message that science is by far the best way to understand the physical world and the limitations of  scientific knowledge does not mean that some things aren't well understood or are not effectively settled and beyond meaningful dispute.  It would be a shame if this study gave ammunition to those who choose dubious remedies like homeopathy to treat real medical conditions because tested medicine that works has limitations and failure rates.  Ditto for those who dispute evolution or plate tectonics, the safety and efficacy of vaccinations or even climate change.  I do fear that a little scientific uncertainty may mean to some that much established and understood  science should be ignored.",,,,,,,
"The current form of democratic thought presents my ignorance is just as important as your knowledge.<br/><br/>We are seeing this in the arguments against vaccinations. Ignorance is presented as valid knowledge, all they think they have to do is google for the answers they want.",,,,,,,
"The value of such classes is obvious, even if calling it ""Teaching Ignorance"" or ""Ignorance 101,"" is needlessly provocative.  The primary difference between religious doctrine and scientific research, once you get down to general principles, is an admission of ignorance.  Religious leaders often sound off about topics that are not specifically contemplated by any religious text.  Rather than say they are not sure about the nature of a given phenomenon/action (take your pick: stem cells, abortion, global warming, vaccines, whatever), many of these leaders desperately assert that the key to resolving any issue lies in a care consultation of their particular book, scroll, or tablet.  Science, properly conducted, is supposed to present its findings and acknowledge the limits of any conclusions it reaches.  If the data is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion, the researcher has an obligation to say so.  These acknowledgments, in addition to being honest, encourage other researchers to continue to expand into the unknown.  By contrast, religion asserts a limited range of responses to questions: (1) the answer is in this book, but you're not pious/dedicated enough to understand it; (2) we're not ""meant"" to know such things; or (3) anything not covered in the book is an illusory and/or evil.  It is telling that the first thing God withheld from humans (in the Christian religion) was KNOWLEDGE.  The institution doesn't want people to even know what they don't know.",,,,,,,

"Alan Sager of BU has spent his career studying drug companies. He has found that spend about 11% of their budget on R &amp; D, about 19% on profit and about 34% on ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù. <br/><br/>About the R &amp; D, most of it is ‚ÄúD‚Äù. Most of the basic research is not done by the drug companies, but by universities and the Institutes of Health. For example, Jonas Salk was at Carnegie ‚Äì Mellon when he developed his polio vaccine. <br/><br/>The only thing I want to say about their profit is that it is roughly double the average of all US industries.<br/><br/>Marketing has two purpose, one directed toward users and one directed towards physicians. Since physicians have the ultimate control (they write the prescriptions), the effort towards them is the larger.<br/><br/>Basically what they want patients to do is to get their physicians to prescribe drugs they do not need. Clearly physicians will prescribe drugs they need without marketing.  This is the purpose of the odious ads we are bombarded with on TV, radio, and print media as well as in the mail and on the NET. Drug advertising to patients is illegal in all other countries.<br/><br/>Drug marketing to physicians is enormous and multifaceted. The purpose here is to get physicians to use new expensive drugs in cases where older cheaper drug do as well if not better.  It would take a book to examine all the techniques used by the companies.

"When people received the polio vaccine, they became long term immune and the epidemic ended.  In order to wipe out Hepatitis C, you would have to cure every single drug abuser in the country and also figure out how prevent them from having sex with anyone  who was infected until after they also had been cured.<br/><br/>If you cured 90% of the infected IV drug abusers in a neighborhood the rate of new infections would drop off significantly.  But being cured does not make one immune to a new infection and within five years, you'd be back at your original rate of infection.  The good thing about that would be that the drugs would have gone off patent, although we do not know whether a second or third treatment would be effective or whether the virus would mutate.  The drug testing protocols report 95% success rates for the known types of Hepatitis C, but only for the first treatment cycle.<br/><br/>Sorry to rain on your parade.  The only way your scheme would eradicate Hepatitis C is if the drug also cured drug addiction.  A rational person who paid $84,000 to be cured would probably be able to refrain from risky future behavior, but the same would not be true of active IV drug abusers who got a free cure paid for by the government.",,,,,,,
"As a physician, I respect your first-hand perspective. However, hopefully you can tell from what I originally said that I am not talking about preventing the mentally ill from getting access to guns, because as you say that is nearly impossible.  What I was alluding to is the need to acknowledge that the conditions for allowing mental illness to arise to begin with seem to be very conducive in the USA, and the goal should be to prevent mental illness by addressing those conditions (cultural &amp; societal stressors). As a physician, what are your thoughts on the article I shared on the higher rates of mental illness in the USA vs. much of the rest of the world? In other words, there is no vaccine for mental illness, so how else can we prevent it (or reduces its occurance)?<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/why-more-americans-suffer-from-mental-disorders-than-anyone-else/246035/#slide1"" title=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/why-more-americans-suffer-from-mental-disorders-than-anyone-else/246035/#slide1"" target=""_blank"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/why-more-americans-suf...</a>",,,,,,,

"Dear New York Times  Editorial Staff -<br/><br/>Focussing on Donald Trump may sell papers and incite people  (myself included) to while away a happy hour ranting back in the comments section while having a second cup of morning coffee.<br/><br/>But can't you take a day off from following the Clown Car and give some time to the real issues in this election, and to reporting on what the candidates are saying about them?<br/><br/>I would like to know what Bernie Sanders is saying about income inequality, for example, and what he would do about it;  what should we know about about Carly Fiorina's baseless comments on ""esoteric"" vaccines; what Jeb is Bush telling his backers about illegal immigration; what Hillary is saying about racial inequality and the Iran treaty;  and etc.<br/><br/>The Times is the paper of record.  It's fun to have a view of the sideshow -- but how can Americans be expected to vote intelligently when they are not informed about the important issues, and what the next President of the United States plans to do about them? <br/><br/> We also need good reporting on how the rest of the world is viewing this campaign and especially the Iran treat. And how can you inform voters about how the rest of the world is dealing with the issue of immigration.

"This is such an ridiculous comment that it is difficult to know where to start deconstructing it.<br/><br/>First of all, the admonition against attacking another physician has nothing to do with disagreeing professionally.  It has to do with literally attacking another physician, or worse yet, bearing false witness as occurs routinely in ""sham peer reviews"", where one doc accepts money to offer an opinion that another committed malpractice or negligence.<br/><br/>Secondly, no diagnosis is treated as an indisputable fact.  Clearly, Bruce is unfamiliar with the term differential diagnosis.  Or for that matter with the basic principles of the scientific method, which obligate one to constantly reassess conclusions based on newly acquired data.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in an earlier comment, those intent on chasing down ""bad doctors"" who are intent on ""harming patients for financial gain"" would probably find much more fertile ground looking at the actions of the banking/Wall Street cartel.  Talk about a target rich environment!  But unfortunately the general public has become complacent with the miracles performed by modern medicine which are now commonplace.  The list is endless actually: organ transplantation, decreasing mortality from heart disease and cancer, most recently a truly remarkable response to Ebola with a promising vaccine already developed.  <br/><br/>Not to mention the biggest miracle of all - tens of thousands of practitioners still willing to work in the current healthcare environment.",,,,,,,
"Financial conflicts are easy to assess. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and the US Sunshine Act require such disclosures. However, the author touches on other forms of bias -- personal, political, religious -- that are far more insidious and potentially more life threatening.  An obvious example is Dr. Andrew Wakefield's now discredited and retracted publication linking vaccines to autism.  How many lives were impacted negatively as a result of that one publication which had no financial links to the pharmaceutical industry. New cases of measles are the highest they've been in decades. New laws have been passed to barring unimmunized children from school.  The costs to society are not insignificant. So, I challenge the author and his colleagues to design and implement a study that evaluates every retracted clinical trial publication over the past ten years. Have the data reexamined independently. Dig deep to identify sources of bias.  Evaluate the impact that study had on the delivery of care and the harm it may have caused. Then publish the findings, assuming you can find a reputable journal willing to examine their own past failures. My guess is that non-financial forms of bias have played a very large role in retracted study publications.   ",,,,,,,
